# GeoSci.xyz EM

A resource for electromagnetic geophysics

**Resources for Contributors:**

Here are a couple resources on sphinx and reStructured Text:

- http://sphinx-doc.org/markup/
- http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html


**Notation:**

We choose the notation set forth  in Ward and Hohmann. Their chapter has been the foundation of many research papers, is used by geophysicists world-wide, and it is clean and unambiguous. 
 
- vectors are bold : 

    ```
    .. math:: 
        \mathbf{v}
    ```
  or for a symbol
    ```
    .. math::
        \boldsymbol{\nabla\cdot}
    ```
  
- tensors are bold and underlined :

    ```
    .. math ::
        \mathbf{\underline{v}}
    ```
  or for a symbol
    ```
    .. math ::
        \boldsymbol{\underline{\sigma}}
    ```
  
- time domain are lower case
- frequency domain are upper case
