Apps
====

To augment the content in EM GeoSci, a number of `Jupyter
Notebook <http://jupyter.org>`_ apps have been developed. There are two categories of notebooks

- Apps
    - **Purpose:** To provide an interactive way to explore fundamentals of EM geophysics

- Simulation Notebooks
    - **Purpose:** To be a starting point for getting up and running with the EM Module of SimPEG for performing numerical simulations and inversions
