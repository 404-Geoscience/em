    This case history follows the use of airborne EM to characterize the background geology of the Athabasca oil sands, where Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage will be performed in the future.

This case study is based on the extended abstract `"From exploration to reclamation: using EM methods at SAGD sites in the Athabasca oil sands" <http://library.seg.org/doi/abs/10.1190/segam2016-13842507.1>`__ :cite:`DevrieseOldenburg2016a`.

**Abstract**

Electromagnetic surveys can be collected in the air, on the surface,
and in boreholes, covering different scales and allowing different
targets to be imaged. These methods are sensitive to electrical
resistivity, which varies as geologic formations change. In this case
history, airborne EM is used to characterize the background geology of
the Athabasca oil sands where Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage is
planned for the future. The readers can anticipate to learn the following:

1. How EM can be applied to heavy oil studies

2. Airborne EM acquisition system and airborne data

3. Limitations of different EM surveys
