Interpretation
==============

:numref:`XXX7` a presents the Balboa deposit cross-section from diamond drilling (after Burge, 2014), showing the 0.4% copper ore shell and the sulphide shells that define the porphyry deposit, which dips northward, and the surrounding porphyry system alteration halos. :numref:`XXX7` b shows the corresponding ZTEM resistivity cross-section, obtained by 3D inversion, directly over Balboa. As shown, the ZTEM conductive anomaly correlates directly with the higher grade zone, both spatially and at depth, based on the 3D inversion results. The Balboa anomaly also appears to extend further northward, subcropping below the western edge of the Colina deposit, suggesting that the two porphyry systems are potentially joined at depth. :numref:`XXX7` c presents the corresponding 3D magnetic susceptibility section for L1170, using the Geosoft MVI 3D inversion code (Ellis et al., 2012), which accounts for magnetic remanence. The section shows that Balboa occurs in a relative magnetic susceptibility low, reflecting magnetite depletion due to hydrothermal alteration.

    Balboa deposit cross-section (a), showing :math:`> 0.4 \%` Cu grade shell (green) and drill-holes (after Burge, 2014), 3D ZTEM inversion for L1170 over Balboa (b), and 3D MVI magnetic susceptibility inversion for L1170 (c), both showing outline of ore grade shells (after Burge, 2014).
