:numref:`XXX5` presents the ZTEM tipper data, displayed as the Total Phase Rotation (TPR; Izarra et al., 2011; Legault et al., 2012), at both high and low frequencies, giving a sense of relative depth of investigation, according to Equation XXX2.  In spite of possible topographic artefacts (Sattel and Witherly, 2012), the differences in the two TPR signatures are noticeable and, as noted by Burge (2014), the higher frequency (shallow depth) ZTEM results (:numref:`XXX5` a) appear to map elevated conductivity closely associated with all the known porphyry orebodies; whereas the anomalies that persist at low frequencies (:numref:`XXX5` b) also coincide with known deep sulphides zones at Botija and Brazo-Botija Abajo, as well as the untested anomaly Balboa northwest of Cuatra Crestas prospect (Burge, 2014). The low frequency ZTEM image in :numref:`XXX5` b also displays a large/long wavelength negative tipper response in the Cobre Panama deposit region that suggests anomalously higher resistivities at depth.

    ZTEM survey results over Cobre Panama deposit area: a) Total phase rotated (TPR) In-phase tipper at 360Hz, and b) In-phase TPR at 30Hz, highlighting EM anomalies that extend to lower frequencies over the Botija, Brazo and Botija Abajo porphyry deposits, as well as the Balboa discovery.

The ZTEM data have been converted to equivalent resistivity-depth distributions using from 2D and 3D ZTEM inversions using the Geotech Av2dtopo code (Legault et al., 2012) and UBC MT3dinv code (Holtham and Oldenburg, 2008), respectively. The ZTEM 2D inversions were performed on the TZX (in-line) component data, using an avg. 30mX by 40mZ cell mesh. The 3D ZTEM inversion used both the TZX and TZY data, and a 150mX by 300mY by 40mZ cell mesh.  Both inversions accounted for topography and used a 500 ohm-m half-space apriori start model. :numref:`XXX6` a presents the 2D resistivity depth slice at 0m and :numref:`XXX6` b presents the 3D inversion result at -500m depth as an overlay on the 2D depth slice, for comparison.

The images in :numref:`XXX6` a and b resemble quite closely the high and low frequency TPR images shown in :numref:`XXX5` a and b; in particular the shallow conductivity anomalies observed over all the known porphyries, as well as higher conductivities associated with the higher grade deposits, including Balboa, that are highlighted in the deeper inversion images and were predicted by the known geology. Below 500-1000m, the ZTEM 2D and 3D inversion results also indicate increasing resistivities extending to depth, as shown in :numref:`XXX6` b.
