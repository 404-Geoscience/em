Synthesis
=========

Although it seems likely to relate to hydrothermal alteration, the source of conductivity for Balboa and the other porphyry orebodies has not been determined with certainty, since the sulphide ore is disseminated and non-supergene enriched. Subsequent to the Balboa discovery, a helicopter time-domain EM (HTEM) survey was flown to determine the overburden characteristics for mine-development purposes. The HTEM survey resolved the 10-30m conductive saprolite layer but did not appear to detect the conductive anomalies related to the deeper porphyry bodies. Since ZTEM is relatively insensitive to horizontal layering (Sattel and Witherly, 2012), the 2D-3D inversions do not appear to define the conductive blanket either (see :numref:`XXX7` b). A synthetic 2D model (:numref:`XXX8` a) that replicates the Balboa deposit, from the 3D inversion result in :numref:`XXX7` b, was tested using a 30m thick, 30 ohm-m surficial layer, based on the HTEM evidence. As shown in :numref:`XXX8` b, in spite of the presence of the conductive blanket, a dipping conductive anomaly, extending to 750m depth and very similar to the Balboa response, is defined in the 2D ZTEM inversion result, which would appear to confirm its detectability using passive airborne electromagnetics.

    ZTEM 2D synthetic modeling: a) 2D resistivity model for a porphyry body, resembling Balboa, buried below 30m of conductive saprolite (30 Î©-m), and b) 2D inversion of synthetic ZTEM data from model in :numref:`XXX8` a.

The Balboa discovery is a geophysical success story, where a significant porphyry copper deposit was discovered beneath cover at Cobre Panama even though after many exploration and drilling campaigns motivated by conventional soil sampling had failed to  clearly identify it.  Balboa and aeromagnetics providing an unexpected signature. The ZTEM appears to map all the porphyry deposits in the tropical environment at Cobre Panama, including Balboa, making it the first documented case of a porphyry copper discovery using ZTEM airborne EM. Our 2D-3D inversion analyses appear to confirm the bedrock source of conductivity that extend from surface to >500-750m depths. The exact source of conductivity is undetermined, with mainly disseminated mineralization and a lack of visible supergene enrichment, although it is assumed to be related to clay-phyllic alteration. Subsequent HTEM surveys also do not appear to detect any of the porphyry bodies below the conductive saprolitic weathering blanket. However, 2D synthetic modeling of the Balboa deposit that incorporates the saprolite appears to confirm its detectability using passive ZTEM airborne EM.
