Interpretation
==============

Interpretation is the process that extracts information in the data to make decisions or to derive geologic knowledge. Depending on the specific geologic questions asked, and the resources available, geophysicists can choose from a wide spectrum of approaches ranging from trivial and low-resolution to sophisticated and high-resolution. The following is a list of commonly available options for the interpretation of loop-loop EM data.

(1) Qualitative assessment of data. In some cases, the data itself showing highs and lows can reveal the distribution of the relative physical property. Sometimes simple data transform techniques can also be used to isolate the anomaly and aid the interpretation. This type of approach can include: direct data plotting, conductivity meter (link to EM31), empirical template method, etc. Qualitative approach was once the mainstream, but has shown drawbacks in complex geological setting and lacks the ability to decode the conductivity values from the data.

(2) Time constant (decay constant) analysis. Link to another page.

(3) Apparent conductivity. CDI. Link to another page.

(4) Plate modeling.

(5) 1D layered earth model, including stitched and quasi-3D. Link to another page.

(6) Full 3D inversion. Link to another page.
