Interpretation
==============

Interpretation is the process that extracts information in the data to make decisions or to derive geologic knowledge. Depending on the specific geologic questions asked, and the resources available, geophysicists can choose from trivial and low-res to sophisticated and high-res approaches. The following is a list of options that can be used for airborne EM.

(1) Qualitative assessment of data. Directly looking at the data, find highs and lows...

(2) Time constant or decay constant analysis. Link to another page.

(3) Apparent conductivity. Link to another page.

(4) 1D layered earth model, including stitched and quasi-3D. Link to another page.

(5) Full 3D inversion. Link to another page.
