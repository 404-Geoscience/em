Processing
==========

The primary goal of processing the raw data is to prepare the delivered data. The procedures usually involve considerations on the instrumentation and field operation. Examples are de-noising, leveling, smoothing, filtering, stacking, spatial and temporal corrections, convolution/deconvolution, transfer function estimation, etc. The readers are suggest to refer to the survey report or the field crew for more information.

From an interpreter's point of view, data processing is a step to examine and edit the data so it can be reliably interpreted in the next step. There are several major reasons why processing is necessary:

(1) Quality control. Outliers...

(2) Uncertainty analysis. For inversions...

(3) Qualitative interpretation. low-pass filtering, data decimation...

(4) Data/model complication. IP, negative transient...
