Setup
=====

The survey area under investigation is along Murray River in the Bookpurnong
Irrigation District of the Riverland region of South Australia
. The irrigation on the river bank (high land) has recharged
the groundwater and formed a hydraulic gradient towards the floodplain. The groundwater flow from the high land to the the
floodplain brings in substantial amount of natural saline water, causing tree
health problems. In order to preserve the
ecosystem, Bookpurnong Salt Interception Scheme (SIS) is implemented to
experiment the water management methods that use pumping and flooding, with a
hope of replacing the saline water with fresh water.

In hydrology, the interaction between the river water and ground water can be
in two modes. If the groundwater table is lower, the river water recharges the
groundwater aquifer, causing the river to "lose" water. If the groundwater
table is higher, the groundwater recharges the river, casuing the river to
"gain" water. At Bookpurnong, the Murray River
floodplain salinization is asscoiated with "gaining" saline water from the
irrigated highland. So the geological question here is where Murray River
loses or gains water, and whether the SIS improves the salinization. These
questions can be partially answered by hydrological drilling and sampling, but
those data are spacitally confined. Fortunately, geophysical remote sensing is
able to provide an overall understanding of salinization over the entire area,
because their is direct correlation between the salinity and electrical
conductivity (see next page on Property).
