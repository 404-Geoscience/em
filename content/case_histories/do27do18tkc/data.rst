Gravity
-------

Three main features are observed in the gravity data (Figure
\ref{fig:gravData}a): low gravity anomalies over DO-27 and DO-18, and also a
low gravity anomaly connecting the two kimberlite pipes. The gravity data
hover around 1800 mGal, from which we subtracted a regional field of 1803.163
mGal (Figure \ref{fig:gravData}b).  We assign an uncertainty of 0.045 mGal to
the gravity data, and invert the data using the same mesh that was used to
recover susceptibility. The results, presented in Figure
\ref{fig:gravFinalCrop}, have a substantial negative density contrast in the
area of the two pipes and a smaller negative contrast between them.

Magnetics
---------

The DO-27 anomaly to the south and its northern smaller partner DO-18, are
clearly visible in all three data sets (Figure
\ref{fig:magData}a-\ref{fig:magData}c). However, each data set has a regional
trend. Any non-zero background may result in extra material (i.e., artifacts)
in the recovered susceptibility model from inversion. We subtracted a constant
from the DIGHEM and VTEM magnetic data such that the values away from the main
anomalies were zero. The removal of a DC component was preferred over a
polynomial fit because the latter can remove part of the kimberlite signal.
The resulting leveled data are shown in Figures \ref{fig:magData}d and
\ref{fig:magData}f, respectively. In case of the AeroTEM magnetic data, it was
noticed that each individual line had a varying DC shift. By comparing data
points that have similar locations to those of the VTEM magnetic data, we were
able to level each line in the AeroTEM magnetic data separately. The processed
AeroTEM magnetic data is presented in Figure \ref{fig:magData}(e).
