    This case history focuses on the use of airborne geophysics for the
    characterization of the DO-18/DO-27 kimberlites, formally known as the Tli
    Kwi Cho (TKC) deposit.

**Abstract**

DO-27 and DO-18 kimberlites, often called the Tli Kwi Cho (TKC) kimberlites,
have been used as a testbed for airborne geophysical methods applied to
kimberlite exploration. This case history attempts to characterize the
DO-27/DO-18 kimberlite pipes based on four physical properties: density,
susceptibility, conductivity and chargeability. These physical properties
derived from 3D inversions are used to build a petrophysical model of the
diamondiferous deposit.

The results presented are based upon the collaborative work of the UBC-GIF
members that were published in a three-part series about TKC:
