.. topic :: Prelude

    This case history focuses on the use of airborne geophysics in diamond
    exploration. Following the `7 Steps Framework`_, this study provides a strategy
    for the integration of multiple physical properties to characterize a
    kimberlite deposit. This is demonstrated on the DO-18/DO-27 kimberlites,
    formally known as the Tli Kwi Cho (TKC) deposit.

**Abstract**

The DO-27 and DO-18 kimberlites, often known as the Tli Kwi Cho (TKC) deposit,
have been used as a testbed for airborne geophysical methods applied to
kimberlite exploration. This case history attempts to characterize the
DO-27/DO-18 kimberlite pipes based on four physical properties: :ref:`density <tkc_density>`,
:ref:`susceptibility <tkc_susceptibility>`, :ref:`conductivity <tkc_conductivity>` and :ref:`chargeability <tkc_chargeability>`. Physical properties derived
from 3D inversions are used to build a petrophysical model of the deposit. At
least four rock types are identified and imaged at depth, which are compared
to drilling results for validation. This study promotes the use of multiple
geophysical methods for efficient diamond exploration programs.

The work presented is based upon the collaborative efforts of the UBC-GIF
members. It summaries the results published in a three-part series on TKC:
