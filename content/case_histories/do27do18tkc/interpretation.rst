Interpretation
==============

In this section, we combine the 4 physical property models obtained from
inversion and build a petrophysical model of the deposit.

Density

Two major challenges were faced in using the ground gravity data:

- The missing elevation over DO-18 and the assumptions made in the position.

- The center of the DO-18 anomaly differed by approximately 100 m with the known position of the pipe and anomalies observed on the other datasets. This suggests that the two ground surveys may not have been
  stitched together accurately.

Despite the potential errors in location, we
view the ground gravity as a valid contribution \citet{JansenDoyle2000} but we
have more confidence in the accuracy of the gravity gradiometry data.
