\plot{gravFinalCrop}{width=\columnwidth}{The recovered density contrast model from the inversion of the ground gravity data. A plan-view depth slice of the model at an elevation of 330 m (approximately 100 m below topography) is shown on the left. Cross-sections through DO-27 (right, bottom) and DO-18 (right, top) are also given to show both kimberlite pipes.}

Two major challenges were faced in using the ground gravity data. The first
problem was the missing elevation over DO-18 and the assumptions that were
required to calculate that information. The second drawback became evident
when comparing the data to the gradiometry data. The center of the DO-18
anomaly differed by approximately 100 m (two ground survey lines) between the
two data sets suggesting that the two ground surveys may not have been
stitched together accurately. Therefore, we have more confidence in the
accuracy of the gradiometry data.
