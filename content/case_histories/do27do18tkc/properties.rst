Properties
==========

The main physical properties for this case history are electrical conductivity
and chargeability. Below is a summary of the expected values for these
physical properties in the Mt Isa region.

Susceptibility
--------------

The Mt Novit Horizon has a high chargeability. This unit, along with the
Breakaway Shales might be distinguishable from their hosts due to the
difference in chargeability. Contrary to what was initially targeted as high priority, the
Mt Novit Horizon is important because it
hosts the mineralisation. The remaining rocks, such as the Native Bee
siltstone and Surprise Creek Formation, have low, to no, chargeability.
