Survey
======

The TKC deposit has been used as a testbed for airborne and ground geophysics,
with over 8 known surveys carried out over the deposit, 5 of which are covered
in this study.

Ground Gravity
--------------

The ground gravity data were collected in the
winter of 1994 in two different surveys. The surveys were leveled and combined
into a single survey. Stations are spaced every 25 m in the easting direction
and every 100 m in the northing direction over DO-27. Over DO-18, stations are
collected every 50 m and every 25 m in the easting and northing directions,
respectively. This gives a total of 972 data locations. The data were
converted from their native coordinate system to NAD27 prior to processing. We
note that only elevation data for the survey over DO-27 was supplied to us.
However, given that the data were collected in the winter, we used our
elevation model (Figure \ref{fig:topography}) and assume gravity stations were
collected on the surface of the frozen lake.




Gravity gradiometry
-------------------

Airborne gravity gradiometry data were collected in 2001 using the Falcon
system with the final product being the vertical component (G$_{zz}$). The
survey line spacing was approximately 50 m.


The fundamentals for the gravity and gravity gradiometry surveys can be
reviewed in `GPG: Gravity`_.

Magnetic
--------

The first magnetic survey acquired at the TKC complex was the DIGHEM system in
1992. This data set identified the two kimberlite pipes. Follow-up surveys
were flown with the AeroTEM and VTEM systems. The inclination, declination,
field strength, and number of data for each system are shown in Table
\ref{tbl:magsurv}. The data were first converted from their native coordinate
systems to NAD27 for consistency. In our investigation, only a subset of the
DIGHEM and VTEM datasets that cover the area of interest was used since the
datasets span a large spatial area.
