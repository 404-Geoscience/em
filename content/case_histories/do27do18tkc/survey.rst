Survey
======

The TKC deposit has been used as a testbed for airborne and ground geophysics,
with over 10 known surveys carried out over the deposit, 5 of which are covered
in this study.

    :name: fig_Survey_DIGHEM

    Airborne DIGHEM survey collected in 1992

The first magnetic survey acquired at the TKC complex was the DIGHEM system in
1992. This data set identified the two kimberlite pipes. Follow-up surveys
were flown with the AeroTEM and VTEM systems. The inclination, declination,
field strength, and number of data for each system are shown in Table
\ref{tbl:magsurv}. The data were first converted from their native coordinate
systems to NAD27 for consistency. In our investigation, only a subset of the
DIGHEM and VTEM datasets that cover the area of interest was used since the
datasets span a large spatial area.


Ground Gravity
--------------

    :name: fig_Survey_Grav

    Ground gravity stations collected in 1994.

The ground gravity data were collected in the
winter of 1994 in two different surveys. The surveys were leveled and combined
into a single survey. Stations are spaced every 25 m in the easting direction
and every 100 m in the northing direction over DO-27. Over DO-18, stations are
collected every 50 m and every 25 m in the easting and northing directions,
respectively. This gives a total of 972 data locations. The data were
converted from their native coordinate system to NAD27 prior to processing. We
note that only elevation data for the survey over DO-27 was supplied to us.
However, given that the data were collected in the winter, we used our
elevation model :numref:`fig_tkc_location` and assume gravity stations were
collected on the surface of the frozen lake.


Gravity gradiometry
-------------------

    :name: fig_Survey_Falcon

    Airborne Falcon survey collected in 2001

Airborne gravity gradiometry data were collected in 2001 using the Falcon
fixed-wing system. Over 140 survey lines were flown along the North-South direction, with an approximate
line spacing of 50 m, for a total of 1,120 line-km. The survey covered a
larger area around the known deposit in an effort to find additional drilling
targets.

.. surveys can be reviewed in `GPG Gravity`_.

    Airborne AeroTEM survey collected in 2003.

The first time-domain electromagnetic survey to be collected at TKC was a
fixed-wing AeroTEM system flown in 2003.

    Airborne VTEM survey collected in 2004.

The decision was made to collect a second TEM survey in 2004 with an helicopter-born VTEM
system.
