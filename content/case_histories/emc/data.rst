The Z-axis tipper electromagnetic technique (ZTEM) is a natural source geophysical method. It is similar to the magnetotelluric method (MT) but only the magnetic fields are measured :cite:`LoZang2008`. The vertical component of the magnetic field is recorded along flight lines while the horizontal field components are measured at a fixed reference station on the surface. Transfer functions relate the vertical components to the horizontal component as shown in Equation :eq:`emceq1`:

.. math:: \mathbf{H}_z (\mathbf{r}) = T_{zx} (\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_0) \mathbf{H}_x(\mathbf{r}) +  T_{zy} (\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}_0) \mathbf{H}_y(\mathbf{r})
