Elevenmile Canyon

.. topic :: Prelude

This case history is based upon the paper: "Three-Dimensional Inversion of ZTEM Data at the Elevenmile Canyon Geothermal System, Nevada" by Sarah G. R. Devriese, Douglas W. Oldenburg, and Jeffrey D. Shoffner. The research was presented at the Geothermal Resources Council conference in Reno, Nevada in 2012.

Compared to the case histories on :ref:`Bookpurnong <bookpurnong_index>` and :ref:`Aspen <aspen_index>`, which use controlled-source airborne EM methods, this case history uses a natural source airborne EM method called ZTEM. The goal of the research is to characterize a geothermal system.
