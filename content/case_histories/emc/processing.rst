Here, we invert the ZTEM data to obtain a 3D conductivity model. An important component of ZTEM inversion is the choice of background conductivity, primarily because the tipper data are most responsive to relative changes in electrical conductivity and are only weakly dependent upon the absolute value of conductivity in 3D environments. To help generate an appropriate reference model, we use data from a DC resistivity sounding. We begin by presenting the field data.
