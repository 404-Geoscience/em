Case Histories
==============

Introduction
------------

Case histories provide the context for our development of educational and research material presented in em.geosci. Each case history focuses upon a particular problem to be solved and provides the motivation for working with particular surveys and shows the effectiveness of electromagnetics in answering the posed questions. For many people, a case history will be the entry point to this site. To facilitate transfer of knowledge we have developed a common framework (
Seven Step Process) in which each case history is presented. Links are provided so that a reader can investigate fundamental aspects of EM, the survey, or interpretation. In some cases we are able to provide data sets and analysis/inversion software to enhance the user experience and to address important issues regarding reproducability. Case histories for our initial launch of em.geosci are those that have been developed by past and present students at the Geophysical Inversion Facility. The titles and a synopsis of links with EM, are provided below.
