**Abstract**

    - The Lalor deposit is a volcanogenic massive sulphide that is characterised as a stack of conductive ore lenses buried more than 600 m deep. 
    - Helicopter sub-audio magnetics (HeliSAM) survey using a ground large transmitter loop and an airborne total magnetic intensity magnetometer receiver was employed to measure the time-domain EM responses of the conductive ore bodies. 
    - The Lalor ore lenses, as well as another small sulphide-bearing argillite, are imaged by 3D inversion.
    - Advanced inversion techniques, including warm-start and mesh refinement, were required to obtain high-quality 3D conductivity models.
