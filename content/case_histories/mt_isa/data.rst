In preperation for the inversion, a first-pass assessment of data quality is
completed. The MIMDAS system collects both a pole-dipole (P-DP) and a dipole-
pole (DP-P) configuration. While sensing the same Earth, these two
configurations can yield different responses and consequently be subject to
different noise levels. :ref:`Data<MtISa_DCR_data>` were first seperated by
line ID, then by survey configuration.

Note that a large portion of the DP-P shows higher apparent conductivity data
than observed on the P-DP configuration. This may be explained by the presence
of conductive units on the eastern edge of the survey. As demonstrated with
the :ref:`numerical simulation<Mt_Isa_Simulation>`, current channeling through
the Breakaway Shale unit and the mineralization at depth may considerably
reduce the measured potentials west of these anomalies.

Simarly, speudosections of IP :ref:`data<MtISa_IP_data>` were QC for the P-DP and DP-P configuration
seperatly. Note on several lines the large negative apparent chargeability
values on the DP-P configuration.
