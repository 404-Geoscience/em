Mt. Isa
======= 

This Case History is based upon the paper: 2-D and 3-D IP/resistivity for the interpretation of Isa-style targets by Rutley, Oldenburg and Shekthman [1]_.

This was one of the first examples of inverting DC/IP field data to recover 3D distributions of resistivity and chargeability. Before this time the inversion of field data was primarily carried out in 2D. We use this case history is to provide an example for inverting DCR and IP data and make the connecting links to the fundamentals of EM as presented in EM.geosci.xyz.
