    This Case History is based upon the paper: `2-D and 3-D IP/resistivity for the interpretation of Isa-style targets <http://gif.eos.ubc.ca/sites/default/files/EG01156.pdf>`_ by Rutley, Oldenburg and Shekhtman
    :cite:`rutley2001`

    This was one of the first examples of inverting DC/IP field data to recover 3D
    distributions of resistivity and chargeability. Before this time, the inversion
    of field data was primarily carried out in 2D. We use this case history is to
    provide an example for inverting DCR and IP data. We show how the current technology
    has increased the ability to recover details about the subsurface in conjunction with connecting links
    to the fundamentals of EM as presented in `EM.geosci.xyz <http://em.geosci.xyz>`_.
