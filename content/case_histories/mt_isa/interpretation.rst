Interpretation
==============

In this section, inversion results are interpreted to bring the final recovered physical property models back into the realm of geology. :numref:`MtIsa_3D_Model_Plan` shows a plan-view slice of the recovered conductivity model (left) and chargeability model (right). The Breakaway shale unit has very large conductivities (higher than expected); the Novit Horizon appears as a low to moderate conductor. The Moondarra Siltsone breaks around line N14700, most likely due to faulting. The 3D inversion shows more detail than the 2D inversions and attempts to connect features from line to line. Yet, the results confirm the presence of a "2D" geology in general.

The previous image presented plan-view slices of a 3D model. In order to view the results in 3D, :numref:`Iso_surf` shows iso surfaces for conductivity (0.5 S/m) in red and chargeability (40 msec) in green. The iso surfaces highlight that the Eastern Creek volcanics are neither chargeable nor conductive to its neighbours. Furthermore, comparing the geologic section on the right-side of the figure shows that the inversion recovered the dip of the Moondarra Siltstone and the top of the Breakaway shale. Finally, the inferred mineralization within the Native Bee Siltstone is not a discrete body. Likely, however, this is an inversion artefact as anticipated by our simulation shown in the top of :numref:`MIM_PDP_Simulation_Model`. The field results confirm the simulation that the P-DP / DP-P survey configuration lacks the resolution to properly resolve the vertical extent of the mineralization.
