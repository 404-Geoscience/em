Interpretation
==============


Cross-sections, plan view maps,  and volume rendered images of conductivity.The Breakaway shale unit has very large conductivities (higher than expected); the Novit Horizon does appear as a low to moderate conductor.
other comments about conductivity and perhaps the relationship between 2D and 3D results.
