DCR

Summary of data collected and processing/inversion. 

Although our ultimate goal is to generate a 3D conductivity model there are multiple reasons for first carrying out 2D inversions.

(a) data were collected in a 2D geometry, that is, the transmitter and receiver electrodes are along one line.

(b) The geology is principally 2D so the inversion results will provide an approximate result and/or maybe a starting model for a subsequent 3D inversion.

(c) 2D inversions are quick to implement and inverting the data will reveal bad data points, incorrect normalizations etc. 

As an example we invert line xxxx. The results are shown below.
