Properties
==========

The main physical properties for this case history are electrical conductivity and chargeability. Below is a summary of the expected values for these physical properties in the Mt Isa region.


Conductivity
------------

    Simplified (log) conductivity distribution expected at Mount Isa (N:12200 m).

Generally, the zone of mineralisation has a higher conductivity than the host stratigraphy. The exception to this is the graphitic and weakly pyrrhotitic Breakaway Shale unit which is quite conductive as shown in :numref:`Cond_Section`. The volcanics to the west have low conductivity as well as the Surprise Creek Formation. The Moondarra Siltstone is moderately conductive.


Chargeability
-------------

The Mt Norvit Horizon has a high chargeability. This unit, along with the Breakaway Shales might be distinguishable from their hosts due to the difference in chargeability. The Mt Norvit Horizon is important because it hosts the mineralisation. The remaining rocks, such as the Native Bee siltstone and Surprise Creek Formation, have low to no chargeability.

Summary
-------
Overall we expect the mineralization unit to be conductive and chargeable with respect to the host rocks. The problematic unit is expected to be the Breakaway shales which are expected to be conductive and may be associated with chargeable minerals. The conductivity for the mineralization is appropriate for the expected bulk copper mineralisation (average 4.8%) as measured throughout the Mt Isa region. A summary table is given below.
