.. Prelude
.. -------


.. This Case History is based upon the paper: 2-D and 3-D IP/resistivity for the interpretation of Isa-style targets by Rutley, Oldenburg and Shekthman [1]_.

.. This was one of the first examples of inverting DC/IP field data to recover 3D distributions of resistivity and chargeability. Before this time the inversion of field data was primarily carried out in 2D. We use this case history is to provide an example for inverting DCR and IP data and make the connecting links to the fundamentals of EM as presented in EM.geosci.xyz.

    Location map of the Mount Isa study. 

The Mount Isa region (:numref:`Location_map`) hosts numerous deposits (Lead, Zinc, Silver, Copper, and Gold) within an area under continuous exploration. This region is found in west Queenland, Australia. Within this region, ten lines acquiring direct current (DCR) and induced polarization (IP) lines were placed over what is now referred to as the Cluny Mine (Copper), 22 km south of the city of Mt Isa.

Geological Background
---------------------

The geology of the Cluny region and the southern extent of the
Mt Isa lease is dominated by fault-repeated, steeply dipping
stratigraphy of Native Bee Siltstone, Breakaway Shale,
Moondarra Siltstone, incorporating Mt Novit Horizon, Surprise
Creek Formation and Eastern Creek Volcanics as shown in :numref:`Geology_Section`. The Mt Novit
Horizon consists of a sequence of mica schists, phyllites and
metasiltstones containing gossanous material of coarse grained
pyrite, pyrrhotite, and magnetite, with variable sphalerite, galena,
marcasite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and accessories :cite:`russel1978`. Exploration along this horizon has occurred over a 40
year period. The best drilling intersection recorded is from a 4
m interval containing 100 g/T Ag, 7.6% Pb and 11.6% Zn :cite:`poole1981`.

At Cluny, copper mineralisation
is frequently expected in conjunction with lead/zinc mineralisation. The Native Bee Siltstone and
Moondarra Siltstone are considered to be favourable host stratigraphy for mineralisation.
