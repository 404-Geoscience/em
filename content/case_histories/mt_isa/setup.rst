Setup
=====

The Mount Isa region (:numref:`Location_map`) hosts numerous deposits (Lead, Zinc, Silver, Copper, and Gold) within an area under continuous exploration. This region is found in west Queenland, Australia. Within this region, ten lines acquiring :ref:`direct current <mt_isa_data_dc>` (DCR) and :ref:`induced polarization <mt_isa_data_ip>` (IP) lines were placed over what is now referred to as the Cluny Mine (Copper), 22 km south of the city of Mt Isa.

Geological Background
---------------------

The geology of the Cluny region and the southern extent of the
Mt Isa lease is dominated by fault-repeated, steeply dipping
stratigraphy of Native Bee Siltstone, Breakaway Shale,
Moondarra Siltstone, incorporating Mt Novit Horizon, Surprise
Creek Formation and Eastern Creek Volcanics as shown in :numref:`Geology_Section`. The Mt Novit
Horizon consists of a sequence of mica schists, phyllites and
metasiltstones containing gossanous material of coarse grained
pyrite, pyrrhotite, and magnetite, with variable sphalerite, galena,
marcasite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite and accessories :cite:`russel1978`. Exploration along this horizon has occurred over a 40
year period. The best drilling intersection recorded is from a 4
m interval containing 100 g/T Ag, 7.6% Pb and 11.6% Zn :cite:`poole1981`.

At Cluny, copper mineralisation
is frequently expected in conjunction with lead/zinc mineralisation. The Native Bee Siltstone and
Moondarra Siltstone are considered to be favourable host stratigraphy for mineralisation.
