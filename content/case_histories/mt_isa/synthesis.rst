Synthesis
=========

This example demonstrates the two important lessons. The first highlights the need to interpret the subsurface with multiple physical properties. Here, the Breakaway shale was a major conductor and the Moondarra siltstone a moderate one. However, the shale is unimportant for exploration in this region when compared to the Moondarra that hosts the Mt Norvit Horizon. Once the induced polarization was introduced, it highlighted the Mt Horvit Horizon within the Moondarra and the mineralized zone in the Native Bee siltstone. The shale is then exposed as just conductive and the main feature in the conductivity model is delineated as non-mineral bearing. The 3D inversion results are shown below.

The second lesson here is the importance of a 3D inversion even in the presence of 2D geology. The 2D inversions, in general, reproduce the large-scale features of the subsurface. However, when the geology becomes more complex, the 3D inversion can show the changes in strike cause by folding and faulting, or where mineralisation grade changes. This is most evident in the Mt Norvit Horizon, where the chargeability is north-south in general yet has variability along strike.
