Synthesis
=========

This example demonstrates the two important lessons. The first highlights the
need to interpret the subsurface with multiple physical properties. Here, the
Breakaway shale was a major conductor and the Moondarra siltstone a moderate
one. However, the shale is unimportant for exploration in this region when
compared to the Moondarra that hosts the Mt Norvit Horizon. Once the induced
polarization was introduced, it highlighted the Mt Horvit Horizon within the
Moondarra and the mineralized zone in the Native Bee siltstone. The shale is
then exposed as just conductive and the main feature in the conductivity model
is delineated as non-mineral bearing. The 3D inversion results are shown
below.

The second lesson here is the importance of a 3D inversion even in the
presence of 2D geology :numref:`MtIsa_DC2D_vs_3DModel`. The 2D inversions, in
general, reproduce the large-scale features of the subsurface. However, when
the geology becomes more complex, the 3D inversion can show the changes in
strike cause by folding and faulting, or where mineralisation grade changes.
This is most evident in the Mt Norvit Horizon, where the chargeability is
north-south in general yet has variability along strike.
