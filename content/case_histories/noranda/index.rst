.. topic :: Prelude

        This case history is based on the thesis "3D inversion of natural source electromagnetic data" by :cite:`holtham2012`.

The case history uses :ref:`ZTEM <ztem_index>` data to characterize large-scale geologic structures as well as identify highly conductive ore deposits in the Noranda district in Canada.
