    This case history describes the VTEM airborne EM results over the West Plains orogenic gold deposit at Committee Bay, Nunavut, Canada. West Plains is the westernmost of many orogenic gold deposits in the Committee Bay Archean Greenstone belt. The VTEM survey highlights the gold mineralization in a series of mainly linear highly conductive regions. Our study presents the geophysical survey results at West Plains and is supported by 3D EM inversions that appear to validate the survey evidence. The case history also highlights the use of a 3D parametric inversion which attempts to map out the conducti
