Survey design
-------------

Choosing the instrument and the survey parameters and layout is usually referred to as "survey design". In most cases, a geophysical survey is designed using rules of thumbs or emprical criteria. In an EM survey, the most important goal in the survey design is to match the scale of investigation to the scale of the target, using the concept of skin depth or diffusion distance. ADD: example. 

Another consideration is the sounding spacing. For a towed system, the in-line spacing is adjustable by the flight speed and sampling rates, and can easily achieve high density soundings. The cross-line spacing is usually a trade-off between the cost and resolution.
