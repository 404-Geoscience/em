Survey Design
=============

- we have a geologic problem, systems are defined, specify the following in the context of that geologic problem.
    - Flight lines and tie lines
    - Control of orientation

    Choosing the instrument and the survey parameters and layout is usually
    referred to as "survey design". In most cases, a geophysical survey is
    designed using rules of thumbs or emprical criteria. In an EM survey, the most
    important goal in the survey design is to match the scale of investigation to
    the scale of the target, using the concept of skin depth or diffusion
    distance. ADD: example.

    Another consideration is the sounding spacing. For a towed system, the in-line
    spacing is adjustable by the flight speed and sampling rates, and can easily
    achieve high density soundings. The cross-line spacing is usually a trade-off
    between the cost and resolution.

    - Footprint: choice of freq
    - Line spacing
    - Flight height



Acquisition
-----------

- These are also things we need.
    - Height - laser,
    - Positioning / location - GPS, differential gps (on the bird )


Field Notes
***********

Due dilegence

- power lines
