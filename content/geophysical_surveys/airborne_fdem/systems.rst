PLACEHOLDER: figure of RESOLVE

The figure above shows the frequency-domain loop-loop system RESOLVE, operated by Fugro Airborne (now CGG). It operates five pairs of horizontal co-planar (HCP) loop-loop configurations at 382, 1822, 7970, 35920 and 130100 Hz, and one pair of vertical co-axial loop-loop configuration at 3258 Hz. The measured secondary magnetic field (Hs) is represented as the ratio to the primary field (Hp) in part per million. More to be added.
