Transmitters and Receivers
==========================


Tranmitter
----------

Transmitter: some kind of coil, connected to a generator that is putting out a sine wave

- current
- amplitude

- Multi-freq


Receiver
--------

- coil (generally): db/dt, but there are some b-field measuring devices(?)
- measure a voltage
    - amplitude and phase
(with diagram ? and links back to fundamentals)


Configurations
--------------

- HCP/VCA
- Separation: fixed
- Bucking and primary removal
