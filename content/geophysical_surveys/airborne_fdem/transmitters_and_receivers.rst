Transmitters and Receivers
==========================

.. todo::

    **Here is some content, some of this may go in data**

    If the current waveform in the transmitter loop is sinusoidal at a certain
    frequency, this system is said to operate in frequency domain. For this case,
    the received waveform is also sinusoidal at the same frequency, but likely
    with altered magnitude and a phase shift. It is convenient to decompose the
    receiver waveform to two orthogonal sinusoidal components: one entirely in-
    phase (real) and the other entirely out-of-phase (imaginary or quadrature). A
    loop-loop system in frequency domain can be understood with a demonstrative
    3-loop model, please read the tutorial (link). You may find the following
    concepts useful. Click the links to learn more in Geophysical Surveys.


Transmitter
-----------

Transmitter: some kind of coil, connected to a generator that is putting out a sine wave

- current
- amplitude

- Multi-freq


Receiver
--------

- coil (generally): db/dt, but there are some b-field measuring devices(?)
- measure a voltage
    - amplitude and phase

(with diagram ? and links back to fundamentals)


Configurations
--------------

- HCP/VCA
- Separation: fixed
- Bucking and primary removal
