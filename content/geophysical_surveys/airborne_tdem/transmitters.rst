Transmitters and receivers
==========================

Transmitter
-----------
Because an ATEM system covers a wide bandwidth using rapid change in the transmitter current waveform, only one transmitter loop is needed at a time. 

- Platform. If using a helicopter, the transmitter loop is usually attached to a round frame towed after the helicopter through a cable. If using a fixed-wing airplane, the transmitter loop is shaped as a diamond attached to the nose, tail and wingtips of the plane.

- Current. The actual current that goes through the coil may vary depending on the power of the generator and other constraints. A transmitter loop mounted on a fixed-wing aircraft usually carries larger current thanks to the lifting capability of a fixed-wing for more powerful generators.

- Moment. A loop in practice can be multiple-turned and is about tens of meters in radius. The product of current, number of turns and the area makes the magnetic dipole moment of the transmitter. Modern ATEM systems are equipped with a dipole moment over 1 million Am^2 to achieve a depth of penetration down to a couple of kilometers.
