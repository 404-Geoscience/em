Governing Equations
===================

 - put a current into the ground and measure the electric potentials (figures)
 - Constant current so steady state equations apply  (links to formative equations;)
 - Equations are solved numerically (links)
 - Potentials for a uniform halfspace (link) or buried sphere.
