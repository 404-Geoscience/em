Direct Current Resistivity
==========================

.. topic:: Purpose

    to illustrate the fundamentals of a DC resistivity survey, provide a
    vision for how it is applied in the field, and demonstrate potential uses

.. todo:: motivational examples to show where it has been useful (these contain links to case histories)

    Direct-Current Resisitivity (DCR)
    experiment showing current path and
    charge built up near a (a) conductive
    and (b) resitive anomaly.

In a Direct Current Resistivity (DCR) experiment a generator is used to inject
current into the earth. The current path depends upon the variation of
:ref:`conductivity<electrical_conductivity_index>`  or equivalently, its
reciprocal, the electrical resistivity.
:ref:`Currents<fields_from_grounded_sources_dcr_index>` are channeled into
good conductors and flow around resistors. Electrical charges are :ref:`built
up<charge_buildup_at_boundaries>` on interfaces that separate units of
different conductivity and these charges generate an electric potential.
:ref:`Data<dcr_data>` are acquired at the surface by measuring the potential
difference between two electrodes. The measured voltage depends upon the
positions of the current and potential electrodes with respect to the target
as well as on the earthâ€™s conductivity.  Obtaining information about the
spatial distribution of conductivity requires many measurement at different
locations and electrode configurations. A generic :ref:`dipole-dipole<dcr_survey_design>` survey
involving two current and two potential electrodes is shown in
:numref:`DCR_intro`. Artistic representation of the current density and
charge build-ups are illustrated for (a) conductive and (b) resistive
spheres in a uniform half-space.
