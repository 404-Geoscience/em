case histories

**LJH comments** I parsed the following list to indicate where I think these
points make sense in this layout.


**DWO Comments:**
DC Resistivity (DCR)
General overview of the survey (material from 350 plus some new stuff;) 

 - put a current into the ground and measure the electric potentials (figures)
 - Constant current so steady state equations apply  (links to formative equations;)
 - Equations are solved numerically (links)
 - Potentials for a uniform halfspace (link) or buried sphere.
 - Data as apparent resistivity
 - Pseudo-section
 - Field acquisition (generators, receivers, cables)
 - Inverting data (Links)

Other items that come into play in practise
 - Effects of topograhy
 - Assignment of uncertainties

Survey Design
 - Factors that are important
 - Depth of investigation
