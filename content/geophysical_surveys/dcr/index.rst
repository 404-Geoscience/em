    Direct-Current Resisitivity (DCR)
    experiment showing current path and
    charge built up near a (a) conductive
    and (b) resitive anomaly.

In a Direct Current Resistivity  (DCR) experiment a generator is used to inject current
into the earth. The path of the currents depends upon the variation of
:ref:`resistivity<electrical_conductivity_index>`  or equivalently, its reciprocal, the electrical
conductivity {link}. Currents are channeled into good conductors and flow
around poor conductors. Electrical charges are built up on interfaces that
separate units of  different conductivity and these charges generate an
electric potential.  Data are acquired at the surface by measuring the
potential difference between two electrodes. The measured voltage depends upon
the positions of the current and potential electrodes with respect to the
target as well as on the earthâ€™s conductivity.  Obtaining information about
the sptatial distribution of conductivity requires many measurement at
different locations and electrode configurations. A generic dipole-dipole
survey involving two current and two potential electrodes is shown in
:numref:`DCR_intro`. Artistic representation for the current density and
charge build-ups are illustrated for (a) a conductive and (b) a
resistive sphere in a uniform half-space.
