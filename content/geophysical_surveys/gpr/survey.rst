GPR surveys use radar antennas to transmit and receive signals. GPR systems are usually comprised of a single transmitter-receiver pair. However, configurations with multiple transmitters and receivers do exist. The orientation and spacing of the transmitter and receiver depend on the application, as does the primary signal generated by the transmitter.

Transmitter and Receiver Antennas
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Transmitter Antennas
--------------------

GPR transmitter antennas generally consist of an open circuit which carries an oscillating current of short duration, otherwise known as a wavelet. The current wavelet carried within the antenna is responsible for generating the pulse radiowaves; which is also a wavelet signal. If the transmitter antenna is small, then it may be treated as an electrical current dipole (link). GPR transmitter antennas operate at very high frequencies (10 :math:`\!^6` - 10 :math:`\!^9` Hz). Ultimately the characteristics of the GPR signal depends on its frequency content and the shape of the transmitter antenna.

Receiver Antennas
-----------------

For GPR, measurements are made by a receiver antenna. Whereas transmitter antennas are transducers which convert electrical current into radiowave signals, receiver antennas are transducers which convert radiowave signals into electrical current. Because GPR receiver antennas are designed to effectively measure radiowave signals generated by the transmitter antenna, GPR systems are designed to use near-identical antennas for the transmitter and receiver.

Antenna Types
-------------

There are a variety of transmitter antennas used for GPR. Below are several commonly used varieties:

**Dipole Antenna:** Dipole antennas are the most straightforward transmitter used for GPR. Dipole antennas generally consist of two bilateral conductive rods. The efficiency of dipole antennas is strongly dependent on their length. Dipole antennas are most efficient when their total length :math:`L` is a multiple of the half-wavelength of the transmitter's current, i.e.:

.. math::
	L \approx \frac{n \lambda}{2}

In these cases, the electrical current creates a standing waves in the transmitter antenna. Because of this, dipole antennas for GPR are designed to have a length which works well for a particular set of operating frequencies. Dipole antennas for GPR typically have lengths of 10s of centimetres up to a few metres.

**Broadband Dipole Antenna:** Dipole antennas can be made more broadband by increasing the width of the conductive rods or by using elongated conductive plates. By making the antennas sufficiently broadband, we can more effectively transmit the entire frequency content contained within the source wavelet signal. As a result, broadband dipole antennas are a common choice for GPR applications.

**Bow-Tie Antenna**: Bow-tie antennas consist of two symmetrically oriented flat conductors. Bow-tie antennas were designed to operate at freqencies between 100 MHz and 1 GHz. Thus they are ideal for GPR applications. Boe-tie antennas have become a more popular choice for GPR applications because they are wide-band and thus effective for a wide range of operating frequencies.

Transmitter Source Signal
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The current which flows through the transmitter antenna can be described as a wavelet. The duration and frequency content of the current wavelet also characterizes the radiowave signal emitted by the transmitter. Some important properties of wavelets are defined as follows:

	- **Wavelet**: A wave-like oscillation of short duration.
	- **Pulse Width**: The time duration of the wavelet.
	- **Bandwidth**: The range of frequencies present in the source wavelet.
	- **Central Frequency**: The central frequency corresponding to the bandwidth. Sometimes called the operating frequency.
	- **Spatial Length (wavelength)**: The physical length of the wavelet signal while it propagates through a medium.
	
In general, the pulse width (:math:`\Delta t`) and central frequency (:math:`f_c`) are related by the following equation:

.. math::
	\Delta t \approx \frac{1}{f_c}

Thus higher frequency radiowave signals are contained within shorter wavelet signals. As we will discuss, the choice in pulse width (operating frequency) is a very important aspect of survey design.




Survey Configurations
+++++++++++++++++++++

The transmitter-receiver configuration used for a GPR survey is strongly dependent on the application. Below are the most commonly used transmitter-receiver configurations for GPR.

Common-Offset and Zero-Offset
-----------------------------

        	Common offset survey configuration.

Common offset surveys are the most frequently used configuration for GPR surveys.
In common offset survey, the distance between the transmitter and a single receiver is fixed.
Data are collected each time the transmitter-receiver pair are moved to a new position.
In some cases, the transmitter and receiver are placed at a zero-offset; otherwise known as a coincident source and receiver.

Common-offset surveys are effective for locating the depths of horizontal interfaces.
In addition, zero-offset surveys are very affective a locating pipes, tunnels and compact buried objects; as they generate hyperbolic signatures in radargram data.

Common Midpoint
---------------


For this configuration, the distance between the transmitter and receiver are changed for every reading.
However, the halfway point between the transmitter and the receiver is kept the same.
From the survey schematic, we see that if the interface is approximately flat, the point of reflection is the same for all readings.
Common midpoint surveys are useful for determining the velocity and thickness of horizontal sedimentary layers.


Transillumination Survey

When performing a transillumination GPR survey, multiple transmitters and receivers are placed on either side of an region of interest.
There are many applications for transillumination surveys, some of which are mentioned here.

In panel (A), a transillumination survey is being used to assess the structural integrity between two mine shafts.
By using GPR, we can determine if there are void spaces between the mine shafts or any potential planes of weakness.
The information collected can be used to assure the mine shaft is safe.

In panel (B), we see a transillumination borehole survey.
In some cases, a surface survey may not supply sufficient information about a particular region of interest.
Although it is more expensive and time-consuming, this type of survey may be required.

In panel (C), a GPR transmitter and receiver are placed on opposing sides of an object; in this case, a concrete pillar.
This represents a non-invasive approach for determining internal structures.
