The success of a GPR survey depends on the transmitter-receiver configuration used and the operating frequency of the source.



Transmitter
-----------

**Add image of transmitter antenna for broadband dipole and bow-tie**

GPR transmitters generally consist of an open circuit which carries an oscillating current of short duration. Oscillating signals of short duration are known as wavelets. The current wavelet carried within the antenna is responsible for generating a wavelet of radiowaves. If the transmitter antenna is small, then it may be treated as an electrical current dipole (link). GPR transmitter antennas operate at very high frequencies (10 :math:`\!^6` - 10 :math:`\!^9` Hz). Ultimately the radiowave signal generated by the transmitter depends on the frequency content contained within the wavelet and the shape of the transmitter antenna.

Source Wavelet Signal
*********************

The source radiowave signal gerenated by the transmitter current can be described as a wavelet. Some important properties of wavelets are defined as follows:

	- **Wavelet**: A wave-like oscillation of short duration.
	- **Pulse Width**: The time duration of the wavelet.
	- **Bandwidth**: The range of frequencies present in the source wavelet.
	- **Central Frequency**: The central frequency corresponding to the bandwidth. Sometimes called the operating frequency.
	- **Spatial Length (wavelength)**: The physical length of the wavelet signal while it propagates through a medium.
	
In general, the pulse width (:math:`\Delta t`) and central frequency (:math:`f_c`) are related by the following equation:

.. math::
	\Delta t \approx \frac{1}{f_c}

Thus higher frequency radiowave signals are contained within shorter wavelet signals. As we will discuss, the choice in pulse width (operating frequency) is as very important aspect of survey design.

Antenna Types
*************

There are a variety of transmitter antennas used for GPR. Below are several commonly used varieties:

**Dipole Antenna:** Dipole antennas are the most straightforward transmitter used for GPR. Dipole antennas generally consist of two bilateral conductive rods. The efficiency of dipole antennas is strongly dependent on their length. Dipole antennas are most efficient when their total length :math:`L` is a multiple of the half-wavelength of the transmitter's current, i.e.:

.. math::
	L \approx \frac{n \lambda}{2}

Because of this, dipole antennas for GPR are designed to have a length which works well for a particular set of operating frequencies. Dipole antennas for GPR typically have lengths of 10s of centimetres to a few metres.

**Broadband Dipole Antenna:** Dipole antennas can be made more broadband by increasing the width of the conductive rods or by using elongated conductive plates. By making the antennas sufficiently broadband, we can more effectively transmit the entire frequency content contained within the source wavelet signal. As a result, broadband dipole antennas are a common choice for GPR applications.

**Bow-Tie Antenna**: Bow-tie antennas consist of two symmetrically oriented flat conductors. Bow-tie antennas were designed to operate at freqencies between 100 MHz and 1 GHz. Thus they are ideal for GPR applications. Boe-tie antennas have become a more popular choice for GPR applications because they are wide-band and thus effective for a wide range of operating frequencies.

Receiver
--------

In GPR, antennas are also used as sensors. Receiver antennas are designed to effectively register signals generated by the transmitter antenna. As a result, the tansmitter and receiver antennas are identical.


Survey Design: Resolution and Probing Distance
----------------------------------------------

The choice in operating frequency is a very important aspect of GPR survey design. When designing a survey, we must ensure that GPR signals can penetrate to sufficient depth in order to image the target. However, we must also ensure that frequencies contained within the GPR signal provide sufficient resolution. We will show that although higher operating frequencies can be used to obtain higher resolution images of the subsurface, higher frequency GPR signals cannot penetrate very deeply.


Vertical Resolution for Layers
******************************

In order for a layer to be detected using a GPR survey, it must be sufficiently thick compared to the wavelength of the incoming wavelet.
As a general rule, the layer must be at least 1/4 the wavelength of the incoming wavelet to be detectable.
Thus:

.. math::
	L >  \frac{\lambda}{4} = \frac{c}{4 f_c \sqrt{\varepsilon_r}} = \frac{c \Delta t}{4 \sqrt{\varepsilon_r}}

where :math:`L` is the layer thickness, :math:`c/\!\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}` is the propagation velocity for radiowaves, :math:`\Delta t` is the pulse width and :math:`f_c` is the central frequency. As we can see from this expression, higher frequencies/shorter pulse widths are required to observe smaller features.
This means higher frequencies/shorter pulse widths are used for higher resolution surveys.


Horizontal Resolution for Objects
*********************************

		:align: right
		:figwidth: 35%
		
		
When the resolution of the survey is sufficient, returning signals from separate buried objects are distinguishable.
However, if buried objects are too close to one another, their respective returning GPR signals can be hard to differentiate.
In general, we can distinguish the signals from two nearby objects so long as:

.. math::
	L > \sqrt{\dfrac{V \, d}{2 f_c}}


where :math:`V` is the propagation velocity, :math:`f_c` is the central frequency for the wavelet, :math:`d` is the depth to the objects and :math:`L` is the horizontal separation distance of both objects. We can see from this equation, that by reducing the pulse length, we can image objects that are closer together. Additionally, it is harder to distinguish objects which are further away from the transmitters and receivers.

Probing Distance
****************

	Proving distances for GPR signals for various materials.

Probing distance characterizes the maximum depth in which GPR signals can be used to obtain information about subsurface structures.
For materials which have larger skin depths, radiowaves can penetrate deeper into the ground and still provide a sufficiently strong returning signal.

As a general rule, the probing distance (:math:`D`) is approximated 3 skin depths.
If we assume the Earth is non-magnetic (:math:`\mu_r = 1`):

.. math::
	D = 3 \delta \approx
	\begin{cases} 1510 \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{\sigma f}} \; \; &\textrm{for} \;\; \omega \varepsilon \ll \sigma \\ 
	0.0159 \dfrac{\sqrt{\varepsilon_r}}{\sigma}  \; \; &\textrm{for} \;\; \omega \varepsilon \gg \sigma \end{cases}

	:figwidth: 50%
		
	Probing distance for various materials from 1 MHz through 1 GHz.
		
		
On the right we see figures which show probing distances for various materials.
Using these figures, we can see that:

	- In general, as the frequency increases, the skin depth decreases and the probing distance decreases.
	- Frequencies used for GPR are :math:`\sim` 1 GHz. Therefore, the probing distances for GPR signals are generally quite shallow.
	- It is very difficult for GPR signals to penetrate concrete and asphalt, as the probing distance is only about 1 m for GPR.
	- Water saturated sedimentary rocks, such as clays and sandstones, have much lower probing distances than dry sedimentary rocks.
	- Rocks saturated with sea water have much smaller probing distances than rocks saturated with fresh water.
	- The probing distances for hard rocks (granites, limestones, schists...) is quite large.


Survey Design: Survey Configurations
------------------------------------


Common-Offset and Zero-Offset
*****************************

        	Common offset survey configuration.

Common offset surveys are the most frequently used configuration for GPR surveys.
In common offset survey, the distance between the transmitter and a single receiver is fixed.
Data are collected each time the transmitter-receiver pair are moved to a new position.
In some cases, the transmitter and receiver are placed at a zero-offset; otherwise known as a coincident source and receiver.

Common-offset surveys are effective for locating the depths of horizontal interfaces.
In addition, zero-offset surveys are very affective a locating pipes, tunnels and compact buried objects; as they generate hyperbolic signatures in radargram data.

Common Midpoint
***************


For this configuration, the distance between the transmitter and receiver are changed for every reading.
However, the halfway point between the transmitter and the receiver is kept the same.
From the survey schematic, we see that if the interface is approximately flat, the point of reflection is the same for all readings.
Common midpoint surveys are useful for determining the velocity and thickness of horizontal sedimentary layers.

Transillumination Survey

		Transillumination surveys. (A) Mine-shaft structural integrity (B) Borehole survey. (C) Concrete pillar testing.


When performing a transillumination GPR survey, multiple transmitters and receivers are placed on either side of an region of interest.
There are many applications for transillumination surveys, some of which are mentioned here.

In panel (A), a transillumination survey is being used to assess the structural integrity between two mine shafts.
By using GPR, we can determine if there are void spaces between the mine shafts or any potential planes of weakness.
The information collected can be used to assure the mine shaft is safe.

In panel (B), we see a transillumination borehole survey.
In some cases, a surface survey may not supply sufficient information about a particular region of interest.
Although it is more expensive and time-consuming, this type of survey may be required.

In panel (C), a GPR transmitter and receiver are placed on opposing sides of an object; in this case, a concrete pillar.
This represents a non-invasive approach for determining internal structures.
