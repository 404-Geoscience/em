For each geophysical method, we will follow the framework:

- Intro
	- brief overview of the experiment and applications
	- links to case histories
- Governing equations:
	- light overview and links back to the appropriate places in the Maxwell’s equations (steady state, fdem, tdem) and physical properties
	- 1 canonical example - this is the simplest example that gets across the gist of what is going on (ie. for DCR: currents in a half-space, FDEM: 3 loop)
- Field Acquisition:
	- Instrumentation / Equipment
	- Transmitters
	- Receivers
	- Survey Geometry
- Data
	- what are the data
	- uncertainties
- Survey Design
- Interpretation
	- inversion
	- appraisal
- Practical Considerations
	- Gotcha’s
