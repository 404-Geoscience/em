During a UXO survey, an inductive loop source generates a primary field. The primary field induces eddy currents within ordnance casings and other buried metallic objects (known as clutter). Induced eddy currents generate secondary electromagnetic fields which are measured by one or more receiver coils.

Time-domain data acquired with a modern EM sensor can be visualized as a gridded image for target detection, or as individual decays over a range of time channels. Dynamic detection data typically extends over a shorter time range (typically out to 2 ms) to allow for faster data collection. Demedian filtering is often applied to dynamic data to remove instrument response.

Stationary cued data can extend as late as 25 ms to support target characterization. Background measurements acquired close to target locations are used to correct for instrument response in cued data.
