Data
====

Time-domain data acquired with a modern EM sensor can be visualized as a gridded image for target detection, or as individual decays over a range of time channels. Dynamic detection data typically extends over a shorter time range (typically out to 2 ms) to allow for faster data collection. Demedian filtering is often applied to dynamic data to remove instrument response.

Stationary cued data can extend as late as 25 ms to support target characterization. Background measurements acquired close to target locations are used to correct for instrument response in cued data.
