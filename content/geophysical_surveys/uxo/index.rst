Unexploded Ordnance
===================

Unexploded ordnances (UXOs) are deﬁned as munitions that were armed, ﬁred and remain unexploded through malfunction. Globally, the United Nations estimates that 15,000-25,000 people are killed or maimed each year from land mines and unexploded ordnance.

UXO surveys are based on EM induction.

EM induction generates eddy currents within the casing of the ordnance. This produces a secondary field which is measured by one or more receivers.

	Electromagnetic induction (EMI) survey. Eddy currents are induced in a buried target by a time-varying primary field. Decaying secondary fields radiated by the target are then measured by a receiver at the surface.


The extent of unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination within the United States and abroad has motivated research into improved technologies for detection and classification of UXO. In particular, the Environmental Science Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) has funded the development of electromagnetic sensors and data processing techniques specially designed to reliably identify buried.
