    UXO survey performed using an EM-61 instrument.

An unexploded ordnance (UXO) is a munition that was armed, ﬁred and remains unexploded through malfunction. The United Nations estimates that 15,000-25,000 people globally are killed or maimed each year from land mines and UXOs. UXO surveys therefore represent an important subset of electromagnetic methods. UXO surveys have a shallow depth of investigation, as UXOs are generally buried at depths up to a few meters. 

UXO surveys operate on the principles of electromagnetic induction (:numref:`fig_UXO_index_schematic`). Compared to the host medium, UXO casings are both highly conductive (:math:`\sigma > 10^5` S/m) and highly permeable (:math:`\mu_r \gg 1`). During a UXO survey, an inductive loop source generates a primary field. The primary field induces eddy currents within ordnance casings and other buried metallic objects (known as clutter). Induced eddy currents generate secondary electromagnetic fields which are measured by one or more receiver coils. After processing the measured responses from potential targets, discrimination and classification algorithms can be used to differentiate UXOs from clutter.

**From Laurens**: The extent of unexploded ordnance (UXO) contamination within the United States and abroad has motivated research into improved technologies for detection and classification of UXO. In particular, the Environmental Science Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) has funded the development of electromagnetic sensors and data processing techniques specially designed to reliably identify buried.
