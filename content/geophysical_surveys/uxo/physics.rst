As explained on the previous page, EM UXO surveys operate on the principles of electromagnetic induction (:numref:`fig_UXO_index_schematic`). Compared to the host medium, UXO casings are both highly conductive (:math:`\sigma > 10^5` S/m) and highly permeable (:math:`\mu_r \gg 1`). During a UXO survey, an inductive loop source generates a primary field. The primary field induces eddy currents within ordnance casings and other buried metallic objects (known as clutter). Induced eddy currents generate secondary electromagnetic fields which are measured by one or more receiver coils.

Dipole Model for UXO Responses
------------------------------

**maybe show a nice dipole response over an object**

Research has shown that in general, the secondary field generated by a UXO (:math:`\mathbf{B}_{s}`) can be approximated by its dipole response (reference). As a result, the excitation of the ordnance item is characterized by an induced magnetic dipole moment (:math:`\mathbf{m}`). Thus:

.. math::
	\mathbf{B}_{s} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi} \Bigg [ \frac{\hat r \big ( \hat r \cdot \mathbf{m} \big ) - \mathbf{m}}{r^3} \Bigg ]

where :math:`\hat r = (r_x,r_y,r_z)` is the unit vector distance from the UXO to a particular observation location. For practical purposes, the dipole response is generally formulated in terms of a linear operator:

.. math::
	\begin{bmatrix} B_x \\ B_y \\ B_z \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} G_{xx} & G_{xy} & G_{xz} \\ G_{yx} & G_{yy} & G_{yz} \\ G_{zx} & G_{zy} & G_{zz} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} m_x \\ m_y \\ m_z \end{bmatrix}

where the entries within the geometric forward modeling operator (:math:`\mathbf{G}`) are given by:

.. math::
	G_{ij} = \frac{\mu_0}{4 \pi r^3} \big (r_i r_j - \delta{ij} \big ) \;\;\; \textrm{for} \;\;\; i,j = x,y,z

and :math:`\delta_{ij}` is the Kronecker delta. The linear formulation allows for rapid computation of the EM response and can be adapted for multiple receiver coils set at one or more different orientations.

Unlike a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere, the excitation of a UXO is not the same in all directions. As a result, its corresponding polarization cannot be characterized by a single excitation factor (link). This is overcome by treating the UXO as an orthogonal tri-axial object which experiences a polarization along each axis. Ultimately, the UXO's dipole moment can be expressed as:

	Geometry of the UXO problem. Fields are defined in :math:`( \hat x, \hat y,\hat z)` whereas the polarization of the UXO is defined in :math:`( \hat x', \hat y', \hat z')`.

.. math::
	\mathbf{m}(\omega) = \mathbf{A^T L A h_p}

where :math:`A` is a 3D rotation matrix from the coordinate system of the fields (:math:`\hat x,\hat y,\hat z`) to the coordinate system for the UXO (:math:`\hat x',\hat y',\hat z'`), :math:`\mathbf{h_p} = [h_x, h_y, h_z]^T` is a vector denoting transmitter's primary field and :math:`\mathbf{L}` is the polarization tensor. Assuming there is no anisotropy, :math:`\mathbf{L}` is a diagonal matrix of the form:

.. math::
	\mathbf{L} = \begin{bmatrix} L_{x'} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & L_{y'} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & L_{z'} \end{bmatrix}

where :math:`L_{ii}` characterizes the polarization along each each axial direction :math:`\hat x'`, :math:`\hat y'` and :math:`\hat z'`.


Frequency-Domain Responses
**************************

**Needs a set of images for geometry and response**

The physics which governs the UXO's FEM response can be best understood by considering a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere in free-space (link). Using the dipole model, the UXO's FEM response can be expressed as:

.. math::
	\mathbf{B_s}(\omega) = \mathbf{G A^T L}(\omega) \mathbf{A h_p}

where :math:`\mathbf{h_p} = [h_x, h_y, h_z]^T` is a vector denoting transmitter's primary field and :math:`\mathbf{L}(\omega)` is the polarization tensor. In this case, the polarization of the UXO depends on frequency. Assuming there is no anisotropy, :math:`\mathbf{L}(\omega)` is a diagonal matrix of the form:

.. math::
	\mathbf{L}(\omega) = \begin{bmatrix} L_{x'} (\omega) & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & L_{y'} (\omega) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & L_{z'} (\omega) \end{bmatrix}

where :math:`L_{ii}(\omega)` characterizes the polarization along each axis of the UXO. In the case that our object were a sphere, :math:`L_{ii}(\omega) = \frac{4 \pi R^3}{3} \chi (\omega)`; where :math:`\chi (\omega)` is the excitation factor for a sphere. From the model we ultimately see that the UXO's FEM response depends on its orientation relative to the transmitter, its polarization along each axis and the frequency of the transmitter.

Transient Responses
*******************

The transient response characterizes the secondary fields which are generated after a long-standing static field is removed. The physics which governs the UXO's transient response can be best understood by considering a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere in free-space (link). TEM UXO instruments primarily measure :math:`dB_s/dt` as opposed to :math:`B_s(t)`. In any case, the transient response can be expressed as:

.. math::
	\mathbf{d}(t) = \mathbf{G \eta}(t) 

where :math:`\mathbf{d}(t)` is used to represent :math:`dB/dt` or :math:`B(t)` and :math:`\mathbf{\eta}(t)` represents :math:`\mathbf{m}(t)` or :math:`d\mathbf{m}/dt` after the primary field has been removed. The UXO's transient dipole moment is given by:

.. math::
	\mathbf{\eta}(t) = \mathbf{A^T L}(t) \mathbf{A h_p}

where :math:`A` is a 3D rotation matrix from the coordinate system of the transmitter (:math:`x,y,z`) to the coordinate system for the UXO (:math:`x',y',z'`), :math:`\mathbf{h_p} = [h_x, h_y, h_z]^T` is a vector denoting transmitter's primary field before shut-off and :math:`\mathbf{L}(t)` defines the polarization of the UXO. Assuming there is no anisotropy, :math:`\mathbf{L}(t)` is a diagonal matrix of the form:

.. math::
	\mathbf{L}(t) = \begin{bmatrix} L_{x'} (t) & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & L_{y'} (t) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & L_{z'} (t) \end{bmatrix}

where :math:`L_{ii}(t)` characterizes the polarization along each axis of the UXO. In the case that our object is a sphere, analytic expressions can be found here (link). For particular ordnance items, the polarization along each axis may be obtained through experimentation and stored in a library. Parameterizations also exist for describing the polarization of UXOs. One such parameterization (Pasion, 1999) is given by:

.. math::
	L_{ii} (t) = k_i (t-\alpha_i)^{-\beta_i} e^{-t/\gamma_i}

which depends on parameters :math:`k_i, \alpha_i, \beta_i` and :math:`\gamma_i` for :math:`i = x,y,z`.


Geological Noise
----------------

Typically, the EM responses from UXOs are significantly stronger than the EM responses from the host medium. In these cases, it is acceptable to neglect the response from the host medium. However, there are certain geological environments in which this assumption is invalid. As an approximation, it is common to neglect coupling and consider the UXO and geological responses as separable, thus:

.. math::
	B_{tot} = B_{s} + B_{geo}

Conductive Backgrounds
**********************

In regions where proximal geological units are very conductive (:math:`\sigma > 0.1` S/m), the Earth's inductive response becomes significant. As a result, processing steps are required in order to remove the Earth's inductive response. The transient response from conductive geologies is generally recognized as having a :math:`t^{-3/2}` decay; thus its time-derivative has a :math:`t^{-5/2}` decay. The decay of the Earth's inductive response is comparatively faster than the decays of typical UXOs. As a result, inductive responses from the Earth generally impact UXO surveys at earlier time channels.

Magnetic Backgrounds
********************

TEM methods become less effective in regions where lateritic topsoils are prominent. Lateritic soils are highly weathered, rich in iron-oxide minerals and found within tropical and sub-tropical climates. 


These soils have been known to exhibit a distinct magnetic response, called the viscous remanent magnetization (VRM) response, which masks the TEM anomalies from UXOs. 




From Laurens

Magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) data are the most common geophysical data types which are acquired for UXO detection and discrimination. Magnetic instruments are used to measure distortions in the Earthâ€™s geomagnetic fields produced by magnetically susceptible materials (e.g. steel). Magnetic sensors deployed for UXO detection typically either measure the total magnetic field (scalar measurement) or the difference between two closely spaced magnetometers measuring the vertical component of the magnetic field (gradiometer measurement).Magnetic sensor arrays have been deployed for helicopter-borne surveys ("heli-mag") in wide area assessments. Multiple magnetometers can also be arranged in arrays for ground-based surveying, with the increased swath decreasing the number of passes required to cover a given area.  Data processing of magnetic data is often complicated by a significant background soil response, which can obscure identification of discrete targets in the measured signal. In addition, magnetic data can only provide limited information about intrinsic target properties (i.e. size and shape) and so are rarely used to classify detected targets as UXO and non-UXO (Billings, 2004).   Our emphasis here will therefore be on detection and classification with electromagnetic data.


As depicted in Figure 1, electromagnetic instruments actively transmit a time-varying primary magnetic field which illuminates the earth. The variation of the primary field induces currents in the ground and these currents in turn produce a secondary field which can be measured by a receiver at the surface. EM sensors measure the decay of these secondary fields after the primary field is switched off. These secondary fields provide information regarding electrically conductive items in the ground.
