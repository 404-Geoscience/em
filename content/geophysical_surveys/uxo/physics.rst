Magnetic and electromagnetic (EM) data are the most common geophysical data types which are acquired for UXO detection and discrimination. Magnetic instruments are used to measure distortions in the Earthâ€™s geomagnetic fields produced by magnetically susceptible materials (e.g. steel). Magnetic sensors deployed for UXO detection typically either measure the total magnetic field (scalar measurement) or the difference between two closely spaced magnetometers measuring the vertical component of the magnetic field (gradiometer measurement).Magnetic sensor arrays have been deployed for helicopter-borne surveys (``heli-mag") in wide area assessments. Multiple magnetometers can also be arranged in arrays for ground-based surveying, with the increased swath decreasing the number of passes required to cover a given area.  Data processing of magnetic data is often complicated by a significant background soil response, which can obscure identification of discrete targets in the measured signal. In addition, magnetic data can only provide limited information about intrinsic target properties (i.e. size and shape) and so are rarely used to classify detected targets as UXO and non-UXO (Billings, 2004).   Our emphasis here will therefore be on detection and classification with electromagnetic data.


As depicted in Figure 1, electromagnetic instruments actively transmit a time-varying primary magnetic field which illuminates the earth. The variation of the primary field induces currents in the ground and these currents in turn produce a secondary field which can be measured by a receiver at the surface. EM sensors measure the decay of these secondary fields after the primary field is switched off. These secondary fields provide information regarding electrically conductive items in the ground.

	Electromagnetic induction (EMI) survey. Eddy currents are induced in a buried target by a time-varying primary field. Decaying secondary fields radiated by the target are then measured by a receiver at the surface.
