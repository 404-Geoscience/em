Practical Considerations
========================

Before attempting to locate and classify UXOs within a new area, work must be done to ensure the survey will produce successful classification results. Geological and clutter can make UXO classification difficult

Important practical considerations are:

	- Accurate characterization of the background response due to local geology and small clutter.
	- Using test surveys over seeded to validate location and classification algorithms.

The Background Response
-----------------------





**Have geological noise and clutter, 3 UXOs at different depths, and the sum. Show that at sufficient depth, we can't see the UXO**



Responses over Seeded Items
---------------------------

**Show a picture of someone seeding an item or doing a test survey?**




Classification
--------------

**If you want to get fancy, show that you were able to recover polarizations but not for the object at significant depth**.



Detection Assurance Level
-------------------------

The detection assurance level refers to the maximum distance from the transmitter in which a particular ordnance item may be classified with 100% certainty. 






Test Survey
-----------

Once an instrument has been chosen and the survey designed, it may be beneficial to perform a test survey. During the test survey, a known ordnance item is buried within a test site. The proposed survey design is then used to locate and accurately classify the ordnance.

Test surveys are used to determine whether:

	1) the line and station spacings are sufficient.
	2) the detection assurance level is accurate.
	3) the current survey parameters can be used to accurately locate and classify ordnance items.








From Laurens
------------

An important step in UXO data processing is visual quality control (QC) of the fit to each target. The example in Figure 4 represents the ideal case: a near-perfect fit to the data and an excellent correspondence between the estimated polarizabilities and expected values for the targetâ€™s class. However, feature estimation is often complicated by neighbouring target anomalies or low signal strength from small or deep (> 30 cm) targets. In these cases, the fit to the observed data will be affected by noise and recovered polarizabilities may be unreliable. Careful inspection of all fits by expert data analysts is essential to ensure that the field data for each target anomaly can support classification decisions. When data quality is poor for individual targets, the data may be reacquired or, in the worst case, the target must be dug as a precaution. With newer sensor data and careful field practices, the number of anomalies that cannot be analyzed is usually negligible (less than 1 % of the total).
