An important step in UXO data processing is visual quality control (QC) of the fit to each target. The example in Figure 4 represents the ideal case: a near-perfect fit to the data and an excellent correspondence between the estimated polarizabilities and expected values for the targetâ€™s class. However, feature estimation is often complicated by neighbouring target anomalies or low signal strength from small or deep (> 30 cm) targets. In these cases, the fit to the observed data will be affected by noise and recovered polarizabilities may be unreliable. Careful inspection of all fits by expert data analysts is essential to ensure that the field data for each target anomaly can support classification decisions. When data quality is poor for individual targets, the data may be reacquired or, in the worst case, the target must be dug as a precaution. With newer sensor data and careful field practices, the number of anomalies that cannot be analyzed is usually negligible (less than 1 % of the total).
