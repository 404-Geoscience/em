Electromagnetic sensors designed for UXO applications come in a wide variety of geometries ranging from cart systems with multiple transmitters and receivers to single loop, man-portable systems. A ubiquitous time-domain instrument in use today is the Geonics EM-61, which transmits from a single horizontal coil and receives with horizontal loops at four time channels. This instrument is robust and easy to use and so is popular for UXO detection and other environmental applications. However, the range of time-channels is fairly short and the paucity of receiver/transmitter combinations (relative to newer systems) limits the classification capability of this instrument.





Survey Configurations
---------------------

Below are a set of electromagnetic sensors which have been applied to UXO detection and classification problems. This is not a comprehensive list of electromagnetic sensors, but is intended to illustrate the recent evolution towards configurations with multiple transmitters and receivers.

EM-61
*****

The Geonix EM-61 is a time-domain instrument with a single transmitter coil and a single receiver coil.
