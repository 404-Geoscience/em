Survey Design

Two types of surveys are common with electromagnetic instruments. A detection mode survey passes the sensor over an area along closely spaced parallel lines, typically such that adjacent sensor passes are between 50 and 100 cm apart. Sometimes perpendicular lines are also acquired to maximize data coverage over targets and ensure that they are illuminated from multiple angles. Along line spacing of data is on the order of 10 cm. Towed arrays of EM sensors can quickly cover large areas, while single sensor pushcart systems are much slower. Pushcart, or man-portable, EM systems are therefore better suited to the cued-interrogation mode of surveying. In this mode, anomalies are initially identified in a DGM survey and high fidelity data are subsequently acquired over each target. Recently-developed systems for stationary cued interrogation (e.g. MetalMapper and TEMTADS, Table 1) illuminate the target with multiple transmitters and receivers and thereby circumvent the requirement for accurate positioning of moving sensors.
