Constitutive Relationships and Physical Properties
==================================================

For each of the constitutive relationships provide background regarding a
basic (frequency domain) experiment by which to measure the physical property,
whether itâ€™s a scalar, tensor, or has frequency dependence. How the physical
property links a field and flux.  (Links with sections in physical
properties).
