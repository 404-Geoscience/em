Biot-Savart
===========

A bit of History
****************

The relationship characterizing the magnetic flux generated by a electric current has been first described by Jean-Baptiste Biot and FÃ©lix Savart, two french physicists. Their original experiment involved a very long vertical wire moving a magnetic needle distance apart.

Definition
**********

 .. math::
	\mathbf{b}= \frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \int_{C} \frac{i \mathbf{dl} \times \mathbf{r}}{\mathbf{r}^3}


This equation is fundamental to forward model magnetic flux created by an active source such as a loop.

Some examples
*************

Infinite vertical wire
----------------------

Given an infinite vertical wire along the axis \\(\\vec{z}\\), infinitely thin, carrying a electric current of intensity i, the value of generated magnetic flux in every point of the space at a distance r (normal unit vector \\(\\vec{r}\\)) from the wire is:

 .. math::
 	\mathbf{b(x)}= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{2 \pi x } (\vec{z \times r})

Magnetic flux along the central axis of a loop
----------------------------------------------

Given a loop of radius R, infinitely thin, carrying a electric current of intensity i, the generated magnetic flux along the central axis of the loop \\(\\vec{z}\\), at a distance r, is:

 .. math::
	\mathbf{b}= \frac{\mu_{0} i}{2} \frac{R^2}{(r^2+R^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \vec{z}

(Note: Considering \\(\\vec{dl}\\) and \\(\\vec{z}\\) form a direct orthonormed system, the direction of the flux is given by the sign of "i" )
