History of Michael Faraday
--------------------------

Faraday's law is named after English scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1867), and describes the manner in which time-varying magnetic fields induce electric fields in matter. Although Faraday is most recognized for his pioneering research in the field of electromagnetics, he is also accredited with significant contributions to the field of electrochemistry; including the discovery of benzene, and creating the laws of electrolysis. 

Discovery of Faraday's Law
--------------------------

Faraday's law is best understood using 3 experiments, which Faraday conducted and summarized in 1831. For each of these experiments, an electromagnet was used to create a magnetic field, which we will represent using the magnetic flux density ${\bf {B}}$. A loop of wire was then held in proximity of the electromagnet. This resulted in a magnetic flux ${\bf \Phi}$ through the area within the loop, defined by:

  .. math::
     \Phi = \int_{\partial S} {\bf B \, \cdot} \, d {\bf a}
