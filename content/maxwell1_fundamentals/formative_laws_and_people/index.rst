Formative Laws and People
=========================

For each of the following we want a short synopsis of who they were, when they
lived, what their “law” is, and how it contributed to Maxwell’s equations. For
their “law” we also want to list or examples of applications. (eg Faraday’s
law is fundamental to electric generators or transformers).
