Biot-Savart
===========

A bit of History
****************

The relationship characterizing the magnetic flux generated by a electric
current was first described by Jean-Baptiste Biot and FÃ©lix Savart, two french
physicists. Their original experiment involved passing current through a very
long vertical wire which moved magnetic some needle distance away from the
wire. They built this experiment together in 1820, around the same time Ampere
and Faraday were also running theirs own experiments, 4 decades before Maxwell
unified electromagnetic theory. As it had not yet been discovered, this law
does not take into account the second term of the Ampere-Maxwell's law, which
is time dependent.

Definition
**********

 .. math::
	\mathbf{b}= \frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \int_{C} \frac{I_{enc} \mathbf{dl} \times \mathbf{\hat{r}}} {r^2}


In steady state, this equation is fundamental for forward modelling the
magnetic flux created by an active source such as a loop. It is closely
related to the Ampere's law.

Some examples
*************

Infinite vertical wire
----------------------

Given an infinite vertical wire along the axis \\(\\mathbf{z}\\),
infinitesimally thin carrying an electric current of intensity \\(i\\), the
value of generated magnetic flux at every point in space at a distance \\(r\\)
(with direction indicated by the  unit vector \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{r}}\\)) from
the wire is:

 .. math::
 	\mathbf{b(r)}= \frac{\mu_{0} I_{enc}}{2 \pi r } ({\mathbf{\hat{z}} \times \mathbf{\hat{r}}})

Magnetic flux along the central axis of a loop
----------------------------------------------

Given a loop of radius \\(R\\), which is infinitesimally thin, carrying a electric current of
intensity \\(i\\), the generated magnetic flux along the central axis of the loop
\\(\\mathbf{z}\\), at a distance \\(r\\), is:

 .. math::
	\mathbf{b}= \frac{\mu_{0} I_{enc}}{2} \frac{R^2}{(r^2+R^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \mathbf{\hat{z}}

Note: Considering \\(\\mathbf{dl}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\hat{z}}\\) form a direct
(orthonormal system, the direction of the flux is given by the sign of \\(i\\) )
