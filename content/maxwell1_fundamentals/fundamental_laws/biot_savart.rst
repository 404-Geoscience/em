Biot-Savart
===========

A bit of History
****************

The relationship characterizing the magnetic flux generated by a electric
current has been first described by Jean-Baptiste Biot and FÃ©lix Savart, two
french physicists. Their original experiment involved a very long vertical
wire moving a magnetic needle distance apart. They built this experiment
together in 1820, about the same time Ampere and Faraday were also running
theirs own experiments, and 4 decades before Maxwell unified the
electromagnetic theory. This is why this law does not take into account the
second term of the Ampere-Maxwell's law, which is time dependent.

Definition
**********

 .. math::
	\mathbf{b}= \frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \int_{C} \frac{I_{enc} \mathbf{dl} \times \mathbf{\hat{r}}} {r^2}


In steady state, this equation is fundamental to forward model magnetic flux
created by an active source such as a loop. It is closely related to the
Ampere's law.

Some examples
*************

Infinite vertical wire
----------------------

Given an infinite vertical wire along the axis \\(\\vec{z}\\), infinitely
thin, carrying a electric current of intensity i, the value of generated
magnetic flux in every point of the space at a distance r (normal unit vector
\\(\\vec{r}\\)) from the wire is:

 .. math::
 	\mathbf{b(r)}= \frac{\mu_{0} I_{enc}}{2 \pi r } ({\mathbf{\hat{z}} \times \mathbf{\hat{r}}})

Magnetic flux along the central axis of a loop
----------------------------------------------

Given a loop of radius R, infinitely thin, carrying a electric current of
intensity i, the generated magnetic flux along the central axis of the loop
\\(\\vec{z}\\), at a distance r, is:

 .. math::
	\mathbf{b}= \frac{\mu_{0} I_{enc}}{2} \frac{R^2}{(r^2+R^2)^{\frac{3}{2}}} \mathbf{\hat{z}}

(Note: Considering \\\\mathbf{dl}\\) and \\\\mathbf{\hat{z}}\\) form a direct
(orthonormed system, the direction of the flux is given by the sign of "i" )
