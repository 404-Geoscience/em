Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields
===============================


Integral Equation
-----------------

The Gauss's law for magnetic fields in integral form is given below:

.. math::
    \oint_S \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{S} =  0
    :label: gauss_magnetic_integral
    
The equation states that there is no net magnetic flux that passes through a closed surface S. This means that there are the same number of magnetic field lines that enter as exit the closed surface. This is explained by the concept of a magnet that has a north and a south pole, where the strength of the north pole is equivalent to the strength of the south pole.
