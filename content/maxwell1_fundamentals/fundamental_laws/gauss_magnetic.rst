Gauss's Law for Magnetic Fields
===============================


Integral Equation
-----------------

The Gauss's law for magnetic fields in integral form is given below:

.. math::
    \oint_S \mathbf{b} \cdot d\mathbf{s} =  0
    :label: gauss_magnetic_integral
    
The equation states that there is no net magnetic flux \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) that passes through an arbitrary closed surface \\(\\mathbf{s}\\). This means the number of magnetic field lines that enter and exit through this closed surface \\(\\mathbf{s}\\) is the same. This is explained by the concept of a magnet that has a north and a south pole, where the strength of the north pole is equal to the strength of the south pole. This is equivalent to saying that a magnetic monopole, meaning a solitary north or south pole, does not exist.

Units
-----

The units of magnetic flux \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is the Tesla (T), which is equal to a Newton per Ampere-meter or (N / Am).
