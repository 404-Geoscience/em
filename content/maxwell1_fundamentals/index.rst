Maxwell I: Fundamentals
=======================

- :ref:`overview_maxwell_equations`
- :ref:`fundamental_laws`

In this chapter we first present a synopsis of Maxwell's equations in three forms:

(a) :ref:`differential_equations_time`
(b) :ref:`integral_equations_time`
(c) :ref:`differential_equations_frequency`

These are designed to be a quick access to the relevant equations with proper
:ref:`notation<introduction_notation>` and units. Each of the four fundamental
Maxwell equations, as well as the conservation of charge, is then explored in
more detail to promote a physical understanding and provide insight as to
where the law is useful. In addition we provide a short synopsis of the
scientists involved in discovering the law.
