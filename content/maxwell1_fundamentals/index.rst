Overview of Maxwell's Equations
-------------------------------
In this chapter we first present a synopsis of Maxwell's equations in three forms:

(a) :ref:`differential_equations_time`
(b) :ref:`integral_equations_time`
(c) :ref:`differential_equations_frequency`

These are designed to be a quick access to the relevant equations with proper
:ref:`notation<introduction_notation>` and units. Each of the four fundamental
Maxwell equations, as well as the conservation of charge, is then explored in
more detail to promote a physical understanding and provide insight as to
where the law is useful. In addition we provide a short synopsis of the
scientists involved in discovering the law.

For each law:
(Use the notation in Ward and Hohmann, except use lower case for integral equations. They were inconsistent in their Appendix. Also, check their use of partial and total derivatives with time. Rely on Fleisch's book (or other EM book) to delineate the subtle but important aspect of this.) 

(a) Integral equation 
(b) Differential equation
(c) Units
(d) Primary scientist contributing to the discovery of the law. If one of these is
    mentioned then have a short "Discovers of the law" a short synopsis of who
    they were, when they lived, what their “law” is, and how it contributed to
    Maxwell’s equations and list or examples of applications.  (eg Faraday’s law
    is fundamental to electric generators or transformers).

.. Constitutive Relationships and physical properties
.. For each of the constitutive relationships provide background regarding a basic (frequency domain) experiment by which to measure the physical property, whether it’s a scalar, tensor, or has frequency dependence. How the physical property links a field and flux.  (Links with sections in physical properties).
