ME I: Fundamentals
===================================

For each of the following we want a short synopsis of who they were, when they
lived, what their “law” is, and how it contributed to Maxwell’s equations. For
their “law” we also want to list or examples of applications.  (eg Faraday’s
law is fundamental to electric generators or transformers).

Constitutive Relationships and physical properties
For each of the constitutive relationships provide background regarding a basic (frequency domain) experiment by which to measure the physical property, whether it’s a scalar, tensor, or has frequency dependence. How the physical property links a field and flux.  (Links with sections in physical properties).
