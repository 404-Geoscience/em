Maxwell I: Fundamentals
=======================

.. purpose::

    Here, the fundamentals of electromagnetism are presented. For those who do not have a strong background in electromagnetism, the content provided here is an excellent place to start within EM GeoSci. After reading through *Maxwell I: Fundamentals*, you will be able to understand the physical principles which govern :ref:`static problems<maxwell2_static_index>`, :ref:`frequency domain electromagnetics<maxwell3_fdem_index>` and :ref:`time domain electromagnetics<maxwell4_tdem_index>` as well as the :ref:`survey methods<geophysical_surveys_index>` used in electromagnetic geoscience.

**Introduction**

Electromagnetic theory is the basis for all materials presented within EM GeoSci. As a result, a sufficient understanding of electromagnetic theory is needed before reading more advanced materials. Here, we will cover the basics of electromagnetic theory. You will learn about the formative laws which govern electromagnetism and Maxwell's equations. Next, you will learn how electromagnetic signals behave in matter and how they behave at interfaces. You will then learn about the fields which are generated by electromagnetic sources. In the final section, we present the required steps for solving Maxwell's equations in practice. 

**Organization**


The content in *Maxwell I: Fundamentals* is organized as follows:

    - :ref:`Formative Laws<formative_laws_index>`: The formative laws of electromagnetics characterize the physical processes which occur when electromagnetic signals interact with matter. As a result, they are of fundamental importance when considering applied problems in electromagnetic geoscience. Here, formal definitions are provided for each formative law along with an appropriate mathematical description.

    - :ref:`Maxwell's Equations in Various Forms<quick_guide_maxwell>`: Maxwell's equations are a concise way of characterizing all of the physics pertaining to electromagnetic theory. Here, four common ways of representing Maxwell's equations are shown. This page is designed to be a quick access to Maxwell's equations with proper units and notation.

    - :ref:`Electromagnetic Wave Equation (Time Domain)<time_domain_equations>`: Here, we show that within a homogeneous media, time-dependent electromagnetic signals behave according to the diffusive wave equation. Diffusive and wave behaviours are very important when considering time-domain electromagnetic methods.

    - :ref:`Electromagnetic Wave Equation (Frequency Domain)<frequency_domain_equations>`: Here, we show that within a homogeneous media, frequency-dependent electromagnetic signals behave according to the vector Helmholtz equation. The physical understanding of this equation is very important when considering frequency-domain electromagnetic methods.

    - :ref:`Plane Wave in Homogeneous Media<plane_waves_in_homogeneous_media_index>`: Here, we expand on the content provided in the previous two sections. For plane waves in the time domain, we discuss diffusion distance, peak time and peak velocity. In the frequency domain, we discuss the skin depth, phase velocity, wavelength and apparent resistivity. Numerical apps are also provided to visualize plane waves in various cases.

    - :ref:`Reflection and Refraction of Plane Waves<reflection_and_refraction_index>`: When plane waves reach an interface characterized by an abrupt change in physical properties, the signal is altered. Here, the physics pertaining to plane waves as the reach an interface is presented. Content includes: Snell's law, the Fresnel equations and Brewster's angle. Numerical apps are provided to simulate electromagnetic signals.

    - :ref:`Maxwell's Equations with Electromagnetic Sources<maxwell_fundamentals_sources>`: For applications in electromagnetic geoscience, a source is frequently used to generate electromagnetic signals. Here, we demonstrate how Maxwell's equations must be altered to accommodate electromagnetic sources.

    - :ref:`Dipole Sources in Homogeneous Media<dipole_sources_in_homogeneous_media_index>`: The fields generated by dipole sources and of great fundamental important to electromagnetic geoscience, as they do very well at approximating the electromagnetic sources used for many geophysical applications. Here, the fields generated by dipole sources within a homogeneous medium are presented. Numerical apps are provided for visualizing the fields.

    - :ref:`Solving Maxwell's Equations<solving_maxwells_equations>`: Here, we discuss what is needed to solve Maxwell's equations in practice.

.. Electromagnetics is the basis for all materials presented within EM GeoSci.
.. Background about the individual laws, their discoverers, and associated
.. physical principles are first provided first in :ref:`formative_laws_index`.
.. The first order equations are then combined to generate the formative
.. Maxwell Equations in the :ref:`time <time_domain_equations>` and
.. :ref:`frequency <frequency_domain_equations>` domains.
.. These equations can be solved once sources are specified and appropriate
.. boundary and interface conditions are provided. Much can be learned by solving
.. the equations in an unbounded homogeneous earth, with
.. :ref:`plane wave <plane_waves_in_homogeneous_media_index>` and
.. :ref:`dipolar sources <dipole_sources_in_homogeneous_media_index>`.
.. We present these along with software apps that allow the user to
.. visualize the fields and fluxes and explore the relationships between physical
.. properties, sources and EM fields. These examples also allow us to introduce
.. concepts, terminology and background mathematics that are used throughout
.. EM.geosci. For the user who is already familiar with basics of EM, the
.. starting point might be the synopsis of the Maxwell’s equations presented in
.. the :ref:`Quick- Guide <quick_guide_maxwell>`. In general, physical properties
.. vary in 3D and sources have many geometries. Different approaches to
.. :ref:`solving Maxwell’s equations <solving_maxwells_equations>` may be
.. required and we outline some principles for helping the user decide which
.. route to take and how to proceed.

.. The final section, :ref:`Looking for More
.. <fundamentals_looking_for_more>` presents detailed information and additional
.. topics of general relevance to EM.
