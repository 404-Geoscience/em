Maxwell I: Fundamentals
=======================

.. topic:: Purpose

    Provide mathematical and physical understanding of Maxwell's equations
    that form the basis for EM surveys.

This section contains essential material to understand Maxwell's equations and
how they might be implemented in geophysical surveys. For many people the
starting point might be the synopsis of the equations presented in the :ref:`Quick-
Guide<quick_guide_maxwell>`, but background about the individual laws, their discovers, and
associated physical principles are provided. These equations can be solved
once appropriate boundary and interface conditions are provided. The details
about the numerical solutions are left for other sources but we provide an
overview here and links to SimPEG that the user can investigate. Great insight
can be obtained by computing and visualizing electromagnetic fields that arise
from controlled sources (e.g. electric and magnetic dipoles) in a homogeneous
earth or an earth with topographic variations. Understanding these fields in
frequency, or in time, provides a solid foundation for working with more
complex situations that arise with individual surveys.
