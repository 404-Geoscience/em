.. Purpose::

    In this section of EMgeosci, we present the concept of dipole sources and show how they may be represented in Maxwell's equations.
    Our goal is to provide a fundamental understanding of dipole sources and examine the fields they generate within homogeneous media.
    
    For each dipole source:
    
    	- A physical model is supplied and the dipole source term is derived.
    	- Analytic expressions for the electric field, magnetic field and vector potential are provided in both the frequency and time domains.
    	- Useful asymptotic expressions are provided for several cases.
    	- Numerical modeling tools are made available for investigating the dependency of the magnetic and electric fields on various parameters.



Dipole sources are fundamental electromagnetic sources which exist at a single point in space.
Although true dipole sources do not exist in nature, they do very well at approximating the electromagnetic sources used for many geophysical applications.
In geophysics, there are two types of dipole sources: electrical current dipole sources and magnetic dipole sources.

In matter, the electrical current dipole injects a primary current into the surrounding area; current does not flow in free-space.
The primary current generated by an electrical current dipole is represeted below.
The magnetic dipole source generates a primary magnetic field.
The free-space magnetic field generated by a magnetic dipole source is also shown below.
Notice how the field lines run through a single point for either source.

Both electrical current dipoles and magnetic dipoles can be represented as sources terms in Maxwell's equations.
For the electrical current dipole, the source term (:math:`\mathbf{J_e}`) represents an electrical current density.
For the magnetic dipole, the source is generate by a magnetization (:math:`\mathbf{M}`).
However, the magetic source term (:math:`\mathbf{J_m} = - i\omega \mu \mathbf{M}`) is generally described as a magnetic current density.
Physical descriptions of the electric and magnetic current densities were presented along with the :ref:`Ampere-Maxwell equation<ampere_maxwell>`.


By including electromagnetic source terms, Maxwell's equations in the frequency domain are given by:


.. math::
	\begin{split}
	\nabla \times \mathbf{E} + i \omega \mu \mathbf{H} &= \pm \, \mathbf{J_m}  \\
	\nabla \times \mathbf{H} - \sigma \mathbf{E} &= \pm \, \mathbf{J_e}
	\end{split}


where :math:`\pm` depends on a choice in sign convention.
Therefore, the right-hand side of :ref:`Faraday's law <faraday_differential_frequency>` becomes non-zero in the presence of a magnetic source.
And the right-hand side of :ref:`Ampere's law <ampere_maxwell_differential_frequency>` becomes non-zero in the presence of an electrical current source.

For each dipole source, a physical model is presented and the source term is derived.
Analytic expressions for the electric field, magnetic field and vector potential are provided in both the frequency and time domains.
Useful asymptotic expressions are then provided for various cases.
Numerical modeling tools are also made available for investigating the dependency of the magnetic and electric fields on various parameters.
