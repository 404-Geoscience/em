.. topic:: Purpose

    Here, we develop the concept of harmonic dipole sources and examine the fields they generate within homogeneous media.
    For each dipole source, supporting derivations and final analytic expressions for the electric and magnetic fields are provided.
    Numerical modeling tools are also provided for investigating the dependency of the magnetic and electric fields on various parameters.
    **Goal?**


Dipole sources are fundamental electromagnetic sources which exist at a single point in space.
There are two fundamental harmonic dipole sources: the harmonic electric dipole source and the harmonic magnetic dipole source.
Although true dipole sources do not exist in nature, they do very well at approximating the electromagnetic sources used in many geophysical applications.
