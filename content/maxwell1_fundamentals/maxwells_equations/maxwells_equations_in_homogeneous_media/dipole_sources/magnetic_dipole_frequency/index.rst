Harmonic Magnetic Dipole
========================

.. Purpose::

    Here, we provide a physical description of the harmonic magnetic dipole.
    This is used to develop a mathematical expression which can be used to replace the magnetic source term in Maxwell's equations.

		Physical representation of the magnetic dipole source.


There are two commonly used models for the magnetic dipole.
The first model describes the magnetic dipole as an infinitessimally small volume of magnetized material (i.e. a very small bar magnet).
The second model describes the magnetic dipole using an infinitessimally small current loop.
In both cases, the strength of the magnetic dipole source is defined by its dipole moment (:math:`\mathbf{m}`).
A physical representation of the magnetic dipole moment and the primary magnetic field it creates is shown in :numref:`MagDipole`.



**Magnetized Volume Model**


This model derives the magnetic dipole source by considering a volume of uniformly magnetized material; in other words, a bar magnet.
Let us assume the volume has uniform magnetization :math:`\mathbf{M}` and has dimensions :math:`\Delta x`, :math:`\Delta y` and :math:`\Delta z`; giving it a volume of :math:`\Delta V`.
The resulting magnetic source term is given by:

.. math::
	\begin{split}
	\mathbf{J_m (r)}\! =\! i \omega \mu \mathbf{M} \Delta V & \!\Bigg [ \! \frac{u \big ( x \! +\!\frac{\Delta x}{2} \big ) \! - \! u \big ( x \! -\!\frac{\Delta x}{2} \big )}{\Delta x} \! \Bigg ] ... \\ 
	& \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \! \Bigg [ \! \frac{u \big ( y \! +\!\frac{\Delta y}{2} \big ) \! - \! u \big ( y \! -\!\frac{\Delta y}{2} \big )}{\Delta y} \! \Bigg ] \! 
	\! \Bigg [ \! \frac{u \big ( z \! +\!\frac{\Delta z}{2} \big ) \! - \! u \big ( z \! -\!\frac{\Delta z}{2} \big )}{\Delta z} \! \Bigg ]
	\end{split}


where :math:`u(x)` is the unit step function and :math:`\mathbf{J_m(r)}` defines a magnetic current density (link).
Thus :math:`\mathbf{J_m (r)}` can be used to replace the magnetic source term in Maxwell's equations for a uniformly magnetized block.

In :numref:`BarMagnet`, we consider the fields from a uniformly magnetized volume with :math:`\mathbf{M} = M\hat y`.
As we see can see from :numref:`BarMagnet`, the magnetization contained within the volume generate a primary magnetic field in the surrounding region.
Notice how the field lines seem to begin at the north end of the magnetized volume and terminate at the south :numref:`BarMagnet` (left).
When the volume is much smaller than the scale of observation, then it appears as though the magnetic field lines converge at a single point; which we see in :numref:`BarMagnet` (right).

Magnetic dipoles can be used to approximate fields due to very small magnetized volumes when the scale of observation is sufficiently large.
This accomplished by defining a source term which exists at a single point in space.
From the previous expression, the magnetic dipole source is obtained by letting :math:`\Delta x , \, \Delta y , \, \Delta z \rightarrow dx, \, dy , \, dz` ; in other words by letting :math:`\Delta V \rightarrow dV`.
Thus the source term for a harmonic magnetic dipole is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{J_m (r)} = - i \omega \mu \mathbf{M} dV \delta (x) \delta (y) \delta (z)
	

where :math:`\delta (x)` is the Dirac delta function.
The strength of the magnetic dipole source is defined by its **dipole moment** (:math:`\mathbf{m}`).
As we can see from the previous expression, the source term depends on the product :math:`\mathbf{M} dV`.
Thus the dipole moment which defines the magnetic dipole source is given by:

.. math::
	\mathbf{m} = \mathbf{M} dV


For a finite magnetized rectangular block (:numref:`BarMagnet` left), the magnetic field outside the source region can be calculated according to Sharma (1966); a better example can be found in Varga.
By taking the limit as :math:`\Delta x , \, \Delta y , \, \Delta z \rightarrow dx, \, dy , \, dz`, the general expression for a block reduces to (:numref:`BarMagnet` right):

.. math::
	\mathbf{H_{dip}(r)} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \Bigg [ \frac{3 \mathbf{r (m \cdot r)} }{r^5} - \frac{\mathbf{m}}{r^3} \Bigg ]





**Current Loop Model**


Magnetic fields are generated by the movement of electric charges (i.e. electric current).
Because of this, a magnetized volume in itself does not represent a physical source.
We will show that the magnetic dipole source term can be obtained by considering an infinitessimally small loop of current.
Although our derivation of the dipole moment will be done in free-space, the resulting source term can be used for any problem.

In free-space, the primary magnetic field due to a current carrying wire is given by the Biot-Savart law (link):

.. math::
	\mathbf{H}









For this model, let us consider a circular wire of radius :math:`a` which carries a current :math:`I`.
Within a homogeneous media, this current loop should have a vector potential:

.. math::
	\mathbf{A (r)} = \frac{\mu I}{4\pi} \oint \frac{1}{\mathbf{r}^\prime} d\mathbf{l}^\prime
