Harmonic Electric Dipole
========================
























There are two commonly used definitions for electric dipole, each of which describes a different physical process.
Here, the relevent physics pertaining to each definition are presented.



**Electric Charge Dipole**

The electric charge dipole represents the most classic definition of an electric dipole.
The electric charge dipole describes the separation of two opposing charges (:math:`q_+` and :math:`q_-`) by a vector distance :math:`d`.
Letting :math:`q` be the absolute value of the charges denoted by :math:`q_+` and :math:`q_-`.
And letting :math:`\mathbf{d}` define the maximum vector distance between :math:`q_+` and :math:`q_-`.
Using the electrical charge model, the electric dipole moment (:math:`\mathbf{p_q}`) is given by:


.. math::
	\mathbf{p_q} = q \, \mathbf{d}







The strength of this polarization is referred to as the electric dipole moment (:math:`\mathbf{p_q}`).
Letting :math:`q` represent 





**Electric Current Dipole**


When considering dipole sources as they apply to geophysical problems, the term electric dipole generally refers to an electric current dipole.




Using a current model, the harmonic electric dipole can be thought of as an infinitesimal length of wire (:math:`ds`) which carries a harmonic current :math:`I (\omega)`.
The strength of the electric dipole is known as the electric dipole moment (:math:`\mathbf{p_c}`).
Where :math:`\mathbf{I}` is the vector amplitude of the current, the electric dipole moment is given by:

.. math::
	\mathbf{p_c} = \mathbf{I} \, ds
