.. topic:: Purpose

    Here, the electromagnetic fields generated by dipole and plane wave sources are examined within homogeneous media.
    Analytic expressions are developed in both the frequency and time domain.
    In addition, numerical modeling tools are provided in order to answer questions related to Maxwell's equations inside a homogeneous media.
    Content developed here should provide a fundamental understanding of the physics which governs many geophysical problems.


Within a homogeneous medium, the conductivity, magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity are spatially invariant.
In this case, Maxwell's equations can be used to describe the electromagnetic fields as a set of waves.

In the frequency domain, the electric and magnetic fields are represented using the Helmholtz equation:


.. math::
	\begin{split}
	\nabla^2 \vec E + k^2 \vec E &= 0 \\
	\nabla^2 \vec H + k^2 \vec H &= 0
	\end{split}

where the properties of the waves are represented by the wavenumber :math:`k`:

.. math::
	k = \sqrt{-i\omega \mu \sigma + \omega^2 \mu \varepsilon}



In the time domain, Maxwell's equations simplify to a wave equation with a lossy term:


.. math::
	\begin{split}
	\frac{1}{\mu \varepsilon} \nabla^2 \vec e  &= \frac{\partial^2 \vec e}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon} \frac{\partial \vec e}{\partial t}  \\
	\frac{1}{\mu \varepsilon} \nabla^2 \vec h  &= \frac{\partial^2 \vec h}{\partial t^2} + \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon} \frac{\partial \vec h}{\partial t} 
	\end{split}
