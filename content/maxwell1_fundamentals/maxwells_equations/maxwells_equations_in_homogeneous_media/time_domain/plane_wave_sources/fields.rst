.. topic:: Purpose

    Provide explicit expressions for both eletric and magnetic fields for plane EM wave equations, and understand the concept of the impedance, apparent resistivity, and phase.

Consider a situation where infinite current sheet at :math:`z` =0 m, and plane EM wave propagating downward (negative :math:`z` direction) due to this. We focus on a specific situation where only :math:`E_x` and :math:`H_y` are existing.

   Setup diagram of plane EM wave propagation heading downward (negaitve :math:`z`).
