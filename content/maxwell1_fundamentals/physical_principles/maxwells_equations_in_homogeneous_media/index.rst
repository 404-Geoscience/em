Maxwell's Equations in Homogeneous Media
========================================

.. todo:: under construction!

In this section, we combine the first-order partial :ref:`differential equations <differential_equations_time>` into second-order equations for :math:`\mathbf{e}` or :math:`\mathbf{h}` and show how EM fields propagate in homogenous media. The plane wave solutions have propogation and attenuating components and the relative balance of these is determined by the complex wave number. When electrical conductivity :math:`\sigma` is zero, the electromagnetic waves propagate without attenuation. When :math:`\sigma` is large, as it is with most earth rocks, the EM waves are diffusive and attenuate rapidly within one or two wavelengths. In many problems, the wave propagation portion of the equation (or effectively, the displacement current), can be neglected and quasi-static Maxwell's equations can be solved. The following content parallels that offered in many EM resources :cite:`ward1988,griffiths1999,stratton1941`.
