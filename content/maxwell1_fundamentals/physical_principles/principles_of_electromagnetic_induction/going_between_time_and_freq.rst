Going Between Time and Frequency
================================

An airborne EM system can work in either frequency domain or time domain. If
the transmitter current waveform is a sinusoidal at a certain frequency, and
the received waveform is also sinusoidal at the same frequency, this system is
said to operate in frequency domain. If the transmitter current is non-
sinusoidal (commonly a pulse followed by a period of off-time), and the
receiver measures the transient field in time, the system is said to operate
in time domain. We make distinction between the freqeuncy- and time-domain
systems, as they represent different products in practice. But in principle,
they are mathematically related with each other through Fourier and inverse
Fourier transform (LINK: DFT/digital filtering).
