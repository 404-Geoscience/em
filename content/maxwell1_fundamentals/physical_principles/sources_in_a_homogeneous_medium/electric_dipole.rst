Electric Dipole
===============

.. todo:: Expand and write more clearly, notation, vectoral moment m ..... An exectric dipole is made up of positive and negative currents of magnitude I separated by a distance dl. {picture} The product Idl is the electric dipole moment and the strength and  orientation of the fields depends upon the moment, so long as the observer is at a distance r>>dl.  

Below:  present mathematical derivation/result, provide a notebook so the nature of the fields and currents can be investigated; results are carried out in frequency and time
