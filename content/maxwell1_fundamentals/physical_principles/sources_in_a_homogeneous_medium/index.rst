Dipole sources 
==============

.. todo:: We evaluate and visualize  electromagnetic fields and currents that arise when an electric or magnetic dipole source is embedded in a uniform hole space. Understanding the fields from a dipole transmitter are essential since geophysical experiments are well approximated by these  {photo link:  borehole magnetics, sea floor logging } Moreover, extended sources can be modelled through a superposition of multiple diipoles. The analytic solutions we provide form the basis of further understanding about the fields in the near-, intermediate- and far field regions. The fields can serve as an important check on the accuracy of numerical modelling codes designed to handle complex geometries.
