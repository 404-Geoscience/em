Plane Waves in Homogeneous Media
================================

.. purpose::

    We have already shown that in a homogeneous media, electromagnetic signals behave according to the :ref:`wave<time_domain_equations>` and :ref:`Helmholtz<frequency_domain_equations>` equations. Here, we discuss the properties of plane wave solutions in both the time domain and the frequency domains. We also discuss the relationships between the electric and magnetic fields carried by plane waves. The content here will parallel materials provided in many EM resources (see :cite:`ward1988,griffiths1999,stratton1941`).

Introduction
------------

Here, the properties of plane waves in homogeneous media are presented in both the time domain and the frequency domain. In each case, the fundamental physics are provided. Understanding the properties of plane wave solutions is very important, as they can be used to describe the behaviours of EM waves in more general cases. For :ref:`plane waves in the frequency domain<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_analytic_solution>`, you will learn about:

    - :ref:`Wavenumber<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_wavenumber>`: A fundamental constant which characterizes plane waves at a particular frequency.
    - :ref:`Attenuation<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_skindepth>`: The amplitude loss of a plane wave as it propagates.
    - :ref:`Skin Depth<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_skindepth>`: The distance an EM wave travels before it experiences an amplitude loss of :math:`1/e`.
    - :ref:`Phase Velocity<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_phasevelocity>`: The velocity at which plane waves at a certain frequency travel.
    - :ref:`Wavelength<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_wavelength>`: The wavelength of a plane wave.
    - :ref:`Impedance<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_fields_impedance>`: A medium property which characterizes the relationship between perpendicular components of the electric and magnetic fields supported by EM waves.
    - :ref:`Apparent Resistivity<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_fields_resistivity>`: An approximation of a medium's electrical resistivity based on the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields.

For :ref:`plane waves in the time domain<time_domain_plane_wave_sources_analytic_solution>`, you will learn about:

    - :ref:`Peak Distance (Diffusion Distance)<time_domain_planewave_sources_diffusiondistance>`: The distance at which a plane wave generated by an impulse experiences its peak amplitude.
    - :ref:`Peak Time<time_domain_planewave_sources_peaktime>`: The time a which the plane wave experiences its peak amplitude.
    - :ref:`Peak Velocity<time_domain_planewave_sources_peakvelocity>`: The velocity of the plane wave at its peak amplitude.

In each case, simulations can be run using numerical modeling apps.

   Geometry of an EM plane wave propagating downwards.

Here, we present the most basic setup for learning about plane waves. Consider a situation where an infinite current sheet exists on the xy-plane at :math:`z` = 0 m. The current sheet is responsible for producing a plane wave which propagates downward (negative :math:`z` direction). In this case, we will focus on a specific situation where the current sheet only generates electric field components :math:`E_x`. By Faraday's law, the corresponding magnetic field only has components :math:`H_y`.

In the frequency domain, we will consider a current sheet whose current behaves according to :math:`I_x = I_0 \, \textrm{cos}(\omega t)`. In the time domain, we will consider a current sheet which carries an impulse current :math:`I_x = I_0 \delta(t)`, where :math:`\delta(t)` is the delta Dirac function.

Solving for a Down-Going Plane Wave
-----------------------------------

To obtain analytic solutions for the above setup, we begin by solving the Helmholtz equations in the frequency domain. Time domain solutions are obtained by taking the inverse Fourier or inverse Laplace transform.

For EM plane waves, the Helmholtz equations for :math:`\mathbf{E}` and :math:`\mathbf{H}` are given by:

.. math::
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{E} + k^2 \mathbf{E}  = 0
    :label: fd_helmholtz_e

.. math::
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{H} + k^2 \mathbf{H}  = 0
    :label: fd_helmholtz_h

where :math:`k = \sqrt{\mu \epsilon \omega^2 - i \mu \sigma \omega}` is the complex wave number. In order to solve the above differential equations, boundary conditions are required. The first set of boundary conditions states that :math:`\mathbf{H}(z=\infty) = 0` and :math:`\mathbf{E}(z=\infty) = 0`. For solving Eqs. :eq:`fd_helmholtz_e` and Eq. :eq:`fd_helmholtz_h`, we have two choices for the second boundary condition: 1) :math:`\mathbf{E}(z=0) = \mathbf{E}_0` or 2) :math:`\mathbf{H}(z=0) = \mathbf{H}_0`.

**Option 1:**

Let us consider solving the Helmholtz equations where :math:`\mathbf{E}(z=0) = \mathbf{E}_0`. In this case, the solution for the electric field is given by:

.. math::
    \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(kz -\omega t)}

Using Faraday's Law, the corresponding magnetic field is given by:

.. math::
    \mathbf{H} = -\frac{1}{i \omega \mu} \nabla \times \big ( \mathbf{E}_0 e^{i(kz-\omega t)} \big )

Note that the previous expression is in fact a solution to :eq:`fd_helmholtz_h`.

The solution in the time domain can be obtained using the inverse Fourier transform: :math:`\mathbf{e}(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[\mathbf{E}(\omega)]`, which solves the equivalent differential equation in time:

.. math::

    \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{e} - \mu\epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{e}}{\partial t^2} - \mu\sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}}{\partial t}    = 0,

with the initial condition:

.. math::
    \mathbf{e}(t=0)=\delta(t)\mathbf{E}_0, \ \text{when} \ z=0,

    \mathbf{e}(t=0)=0, \ \text{when} \ z\neq 0.

**Option 2:**

If boundary condition 2) is used in to solve Eq. :eq:`fd_helmholtz_h`, then the magnetic field has a solution:

.. math::
    \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{H}_0 e^{i(kz - \omega t)}

Using the Ampere-Maxwell equation, the corresponding electric field is given by:

.. math::
    \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{\sigma + i\omega\epsilon} \nabla \times \big ( \mathbf{H_0}e^{i(kz - \omega t)} \big )

Note that the previous expression is in fact a solution to :eq:`fd_helmholtz_e`.

The solution in the time domain can be obtained using the inverse Fourier transform: :math:`\mathbf{h}(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[\mathbf{H}(\omega)]`, which solves the equivalent differential equation in time:

.. math::

    \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{h} - \mu\epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{h}}{\partial t^2} - \mu\sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{h}}{\partial t}    = 0,

with the initial condition:

.. math::
    \mathbf{h}(t=0)=\delta(t)\mathbf{H}_0, \ \text{when} \ z=0,

    \mathbf{h}(t=0)=0, \ \text{when} \ z\neq 0.

.. note::
    Although solutions to the Helmholtz equation contain terms of the form :math:`e^{-i\omega t}`, these terms are often suppressed for more concise notation.

**To Summarize:**

Solutions to the Helmholtz equations, and the wave equations, can be obtained two ways. Either we solve for the electric field and use it to obtain the magnetic field, or visa versa. In the following material, we will solve the scenario illustrated in :numref:`planewavedown` by using our second choice in boundary conditions; which solves for the magnetic field and uses it to obtain the electric field.

In following sections, we derive analytic expressions for the plane wave EM fields in both frequency and time domain. Important physical behaviours of each solution are discussed (Analytic Solution section) along with the relationship between EM fields (Fields section). Finally, using numerical apps, we simulate plane EM fields, and visualize them (Simulation section).
