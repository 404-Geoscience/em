Plane Waves in Homogeneous Media
================================

.. purpose::

    We have already shown that in a homogeneous media, electromagnetic signals behave according to the :ref:`wave<time_domain_equations>` and :ref:`Helmholtz<frequency_domain_equations>` equations. Here, we discuss the properties of plane wave solutions in both time and frequency. The information provided here is augmented with two :ref:`interactive apps<apps_index>`. We also discuss the relationships between the electric and magnetic fields carried by plane waves. The content here will parallel materials provided in many EM resources (see :cite:`ward1988,griffiths1999,stratton1941`).

Introduction
------------

Here, the properties of plane waves in homogeneous media are presented in both time and frequency. In each case, the fundamental physics are discussed and :ref:`interactive apps<apps_index>` are used to augment the information provided. Material on planewaves in this section, and the associated apps, are separated into two parts:

    1) FDEM Planewaves in Homogeneous Media. 
    2) TDEM Planewaves in Homogeneous Media. 

Understanding the properties of plane wave solutions in time and frequency is very important, as these properties can be used to describe the behaviours of EM waves in more general cases. For :ref:`plane waves in the frequency domain<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_analytic_solution>`, we will discuss:

    - :ref:`Wavenumber<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_wavenumber>`: A fundamental constant which characterizes plane waves at a particular frequency.
    - :ref:`Attenuation<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_skindepth>`: The amplitude loss of a plane wave as it propagates.
    - :ref:`Skin Depth<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_skindepth>`: The distance an EM wave travels before it experiences an amplitude loss of :math:`1/e`.
    - :ref:`Phase Velocity<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_phasevelocity>`: The velocity at which plane waves at a certain frequency travel.
    - :ref:`Wavelength<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_wavelength>`: The wavelength of a plane wave.
    - :ref:`Impedance<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_fields_impedance>`: A medium property which characterizes the relationship between perpendicular components of the electric and magnetic fields supported by EM waves.
    - :ref:`Apparent Resistivity<frequency_domain_plane_wave_sources_fields_resistivity>`: An approximation of a medium's electrical resistivity based on the relationship between the electric and magnetic fields.

For :ref:`plane waves in the time domain<time_domain_plane_wave_sources_analytic_solution>`, we will discuss:

    - :ref:`Peak Distance (Diffusion Distance)<time_domain_planewave_sources_diffusiondistance>`: The distance at which a plane wave generated by an impulse experiences its peak amplitude.
    - :ref:`Peak Time<time_domain_planewave_sources_peaktime>`: The time a which the plane wave experiences its peak amplitude.
    - :ref:`Peak Velocity<time_domain_planewave_sources_peakvelocity>`: The velocity of the plane wave at its peak amplitude.

    While navigating through the subsequent materials on planewaves in homogeneous media, it is suggested that you go to the :ref:`apps page<apps_index>` and open the corresponding applications. Instructions for how to run applications can be found on the :ref:`apps page<apps_index>`. The related apps are **"FDEM_Planewave_Wholespace"** and **"TDEM_Planewave_Wholespace"**.

FDEM Planewaves in Homogeneous Media
------------------------------------

A fundamental understanding of planewave propagation in the frequency domain can be obtained by using the **"FDEM_Planewave_Wholespace"** App; which plots the associated EM fields and demonstrates how the planewave properties depend on frequency and the properties of the medium. Here, we provide a cursory description of planewaves in the frequency domain by considering a downward propagating planewave. A separate page is devoted to deriving the planewave solution and defining frequency-dependent planewave properties in detail (link).

   Geometry of an EM plane wave propagating downwards.

In the frequency domain, the EM fields supported by planewaves in a homogeneous medium are characterized by the vector Helmholtz equation:

.. math::
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{E} + k^2 \mathbf{E}  &= 0\\
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{H} + k^2 \mathbf{H}  &= 0
    :name: Helmholtz_full_analytic

where the properties of the EM waves are defined by a complex wavenumber:

.. math::
    k = \sqrt{\mu \epsilon \omega^2 - i \mu \sigma \omega}
    :name: Helmholtz_complex_wavenumber

The App considers a downward propagating planewave which results from an infinite current sheet on the xy-plane at :math:`z` = 0 m. The current sheet is polarized with a current :math:`I(\omega ) = I_x \textrm{cos}(\omega t)` such that it only generates electric field components along the x-direction. By Faraday's law, the corresponding magnetic field only has components along the y-direction. The analytic solution for the electric field in this case is given by:

.. math::
    \mathbf{E}(\omega) = E_{x,0}^- \, e^{ikz} \mathbf{u_x}
    :name:

where :math:`E_{x,0}^-` is the scalar amplitude and :math:`\mathbf{u_x}` is the unit vector in the x-direction. Where :math:`\mathbf{u_y}` is the unit vector in the y-direction, the analytic solution for the corresponding magnetic field is given by:

.. math::
    \mathbf{H}(\omega) = - \frac{k}{\omega \mu} E_{x,0}^- \, e^{ikz} \mathbf{u_y}

TDEM Planewaves in Homogeneous Media
------------------------------------

A fundamental understanding of planewave propagation in the time domain can be obtained by using the **"TDEM_Planewave_Wholespace"** App; which plots the associated EM fields and demonstrates how time-dependent planewave properties depend on the properties of the medium. Here, we provide a cursory description of planewaves in the frequency domain by considering a downward propagating planewave. A separate page is devoted to deriving the planewave solution and defining time-dependent planewave properties in detail (link).

   Geometry of an EM plane wave propagating downwards.

In the time domain, the EM fields supported by planewaves in a homogeneous medium are characterized by the wave equation:

.. math:: 
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{e} - \mu\epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{e}}{\partial t^2} - \mu\sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{e}}{\partial t} &= 0\\
    \boldsymbol{\nabla}^2 \mathbf{h} - \mu\epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{h}}{\partial t^2} - \mu\sigma \frac{\partial \mathbf{h}}{\partial t} &= 0
    :name: Wave_full_analytic

The App considers a downward propagating planewave which results from an infinite current sheet on the xy-plane at :math:`z` = 0 m. The current sheet is polarized with an impulse current such that it generates an initial electric field :math:`\mathbf{e}(t) = E_{x,0}^- \delta (t) \mathbf{u_x}`. As a result, the planewave only supports electric field components along the x-direction. By Faraday's law, the corresponding magnetic field only has components along the y-direction.

In order to provide an intuitive understanding, we will first consider the quasi-stative solution. The analytic solution for the electric field in this case is given by:

.. math::
    \mathbf{e}(t>0) = - E_{x,0}^- \frac{\big ( \mu \sigma \big )^{1/2}}{2\pi^{1/2} t^{3/2}} e^{-\mu\sigma z^2/4t} \mathbf{u_x}
    :name:

where :math:`E_{x,0}^-` is the scalar amplitude and :math:`\mathbf{u_x}` is the unit vector in the x-direction. Where :math:`\mathbf{u_y}` is the unit vector in the y-direction, the analytic solution for the corresponding magnetic field is given by:

.. math::
    \mathbf{h}(t>0) = E_{x,0}^- \sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\pi \mu t}} e^{-\mu\sigma z^2/4t} \mathbf{u_y}
