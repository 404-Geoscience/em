Maxwell's Equations in Four Forms
=================================

.. purpose::
	
	Having provided the set of :ref:`formative laws<formative_laws_index>` for electromagnetics, we present four common representations of Maxwell's equations. This is meant to serve as a quick guide.

Maxwell's equations are comprised of the first four :ref:`formative laws<formative_laws_index>`; i.e. :ref:`Gauss's law for electric fields<gauss_electric>`, :ref:`Gauss's law for magnetic fields<gauss_magnetic>`, :ref:`Faraday's law<faraday>` and the :ref:`Ampere-Maxwell law<ampere_maxwell>`. Although we tend to state Gauss's law's for electric and magnetic fields explicitly, it should be noted that all remaining formative law may be derived from Farday's law and the Ampere-Maxwell law.

In this section, we will provide four forms for representing Maxwell's equations:

(a) :ref:`differential_equations_time`
(b) :ref:`integral_equations_time`
(c) :ref:`differential_equations_frequency`

.. (d) :ref:`integral_equations_frequency`

This page is designed to be a quick access to the relevant equations with proper
:ref:`notation<introduction_notation>` and units.
