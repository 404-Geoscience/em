Maxwell's Equations in Four Forms
=================================

.. purpose::
	
	Having provided the set of formative laws for electromagnetics (link), here we present the four most common representations of Maxwell's equations. This is meant to serve as a quick guide.

In this section we present Maxwell's equations in four forms:

(a) :ref:`differential_equations_time`
(b) :ref:`integral_equations_time`
(c) :ref:`differential_equations_frequency`

.. (d) :ref:`integral_equations_frequency`

This page is designed to be a quick access to the relevant equations with proper
:ref:`notation<introduction_notation>` and units.

Variables and Units
-------------------

The variables and units for relevant quantities in Maxwell's equations is given here.

.. This because of the include statement, we don't need a toctree entry for the maxwell variables page (and want to suppress warnings)
