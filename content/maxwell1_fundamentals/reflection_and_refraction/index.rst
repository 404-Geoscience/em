Reflection and refraction of plane waves
========================================

.. purpose::

    When plane waves reach an interface that is characterized by an abrupt change in physical properties, a portion of the signal is reflected and a portion of the signal is transmitted. Here, we provide theory which describes the behaviour of plane waves as they reach interfaces. Numerical modelling apps are provided to simulate these behaviours.

The 


Electromagnetic waves are reflected and refracted at a plane interface separating media of different electrical parameters. The reflection and refraction at an interface of plane waves are governed by Snell's law and Fresnel equations.

We summarize fundamentals for both Snell's law and the Fresnel equations respectively relating angular relationship and magnitude of plane waves at each media. The concepts of wave impedance and impedance at a plane interface are then introduced. The notion of total reflection and Brewster angle for dielectric media will be considered. The plane-layered impedance of an n-layered isotropic earth, important to 1D interpretation of magnetotelluric (MT) and audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) data, is summarized.
