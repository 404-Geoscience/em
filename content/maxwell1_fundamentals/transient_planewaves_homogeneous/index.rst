Transient Plane Waves in Homogeneous Media
==========================================

.. purpose::

    We have already shown that in a homogeneous media, transient electromagnetic signals behave according to the :ref:`wave<time_domain_equations>` equation. Here, we discuss the properties of transient plane wave solutions in the time domain. Educational content is augmented by using the :ref:`interactive apps<apps_index>` provided to answer a set of fundamental questions.. We also discuss the relationships between the electric and magnetic fields carried by plane waves. The content here parallels materials provided in many EM resources (see :cite:`ward1988,griffiths1999,stratton1941`).

Introduction
------------

We have previously shown that in homogeneous media, the propagation of electromagnetic signals in the time domain is governed by the :ref:`wave equation<time_domain_equations>`. One solution for this equation is a plane wave, where electric and magnetic fields lie in a 2D plane and the wave propagates in a direction perpendicular to that plane. Physically, the planewave solution offer a good approximation to what is happening far away from an electromagnetic source. As a result, planewaves form a primary basis for understanding and working with many electromagnetic phenomena.

   Geometry of an EM plane wave propagating downwards.

Here, we explore the propagation of plane waves in the time domain (for impulse signals). :ref:`Apps<transient_planewaves_homogeneous_index_app>` are provided that allow you to explore the concepts of diffusion and other aspects of the propagating EM fields. :ref:`Questions<transient_planewaves_homogeneous_questions>` are provided to promote interactive learning. The resource is augmented with derivations and equations that quantify the information learned through using the apps.

**Quick Links:**

    - A derivation for the planewave solution is found :ref:`here<transient_planewaves_homogeneous_derivation>`.
    - The supporting math for the app is found here (link).
    - Questions which can be solved using the app are found :ref:`here<transient_planewaves_homogeneous_questions>`.

The content provided here parallels materials from many EM resources (see [WH88][Gri99][Str41]).

Plane Wave Properties
---------------------

There are numerous properties which can be used to understand the propagation of planewaves in the time domain. Understanding these properties is very important, as they can be used to describe the behaviours of EM waves in more general cases. Here, we will discuss the following properties:

    - :ref:`Peak Distance (Diffusion Distance)<transient_planewaves_homogeneous_diffusiondistance>`: The distance at which a plane wave generated by an impulse experiences its peak amplitude.
    - :ref:`Peak Time<transient_planewaves_homogeneous_diffusiondistance_peaktime>`: The time a which the plane wave experiences its peak amplitude.
    - :ref:`Peak Velocity<transient_planewaves_homogeneous_diffusiondistance_peakvelocity>`: The velocity of the plane wave at its peak amplitude.

Transient Planewaves App

.. geosciapp::
    While navigating through the subsequent materials on planewaves in homogeneous media, it is suggested that you go to the :ref:`apps page<apps_index>` and open the Jupyter notebook for the **TDEM_Planewave_Wholespace** app.

.. A fundamental understanding of planewave propagation in the time domain can be obtained by using the **"TDEM_Planewave_Wholespace"** App; which plots the associated EM fields and demonstrates how time-dependent planewave properties depend on the properties of the medium. Here, we provide a cursory description of planewaves in the frequency domain by considering a downward propagating planewave. A separate page is devoted to deriving the planewave solution and defining time-dependent planewave properties in detail (link).
