Peak Time
=========

The peak time is the time at which the maximum signal amplitude is observed at a particular location. The peak time observed in :numref:`Ward1988Fig1_2` (a) can be dervied by setting the time derivative of Eq. :eq:`e_impulse_quasistatic` to zero:

.. math::
    t_{max} = \frac{\mu\sigma z^2}{6}
    :label: tmax

For an impulse excitation, the peak time is proportional to the square of the distance traveled.
