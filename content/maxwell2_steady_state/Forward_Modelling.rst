  Geological section pasted onto 2D modelling mesh.

We can visualize where current flows and where charge buildup occurs for a single pole source.

  Current density (top figure) and charge density (bottom figure).
  
We can simulate the data from a pole-dipole survey and plot it in a pseudosections. Not that pseudosections do not represent the true geology. Note how the two pseudosections below differ significantly depending on whether the data is collected from west to east or east to west.

 	Data for pole moving east to west.
  
.. figure:: Pseudo_PDP_West.gif

 	Data for pole moving west to east.
