Conducting sphere in a uniform electric field
=============================================

A sphere in a whole-space provides a simple geometry to examine a variety of
questions and can provide powerful physical insights into a variety of
problems. Here we examine the case of a conducting sphere in a uniform
electrostatic field. This scenario gives us a setting to examine aspects of
the DC resistivity experiment, including the behavior of electric fields,
current density and the build up of charges at interfaces. This work follows
the derivation in [1]_ and is supported by apps developed in a `Jupyter
Notebook`_.

Setup
-----

The problem setup is shown in the figure below, where we have

- a uniform electric fields oriented in the \\(x\\)-direction: \\(\\mathbf{E_0} = E_0 \\mathbf{\\hat{x}}\\)
- a whole-space background with conductivity \\(\\sigma_0\\)
- a sphere with radius \\(R\\) and conductivity \\(\\sigma_1\\)
