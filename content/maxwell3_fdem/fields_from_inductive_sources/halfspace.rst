Half-space
==========

.. purpose::

    With a simple half-space model we explore electric field, magnetic flux, and conduction currents in the domain. By analyzing those fields with variable transmitting frequency, conductivity, and susceptibility values, we understand how the inductive source exicte the earth. In addition, we discuss how the measured magnetic data behave as a function of frequency.

Oscillating magnetic flux is generated by inected sinusoidal current in the loop, and will generate induced electric field everywhere due to Faraday's law:

.. math::
    \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\imath \omega \mathbf{B}
    :label: faraday


Because conductivity of the air is zero (:math:`\sigma_{air} \approx 0`), conduction currents in the earth is zero (:math:`\mathbf{J_c}=\sigma \mathbf{E}`). From Ampere's law:

.. math::
    \nabla \times \mathbf{H}  = \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{J}_e + \mathbf{J}_c
    :label: ampere

we can obtain Biot-Savart Law shown in :ref:`biot_savart`, which allows us to compute magentic flux density. For the free-space case, conduction current is zero hence only current source term :math:`\mathbf{J}_e` will be taken account hence by applying Biot-Savart law to this we can obtain primary magnetic flux :math:`\mathbf{B}^{p}`. Similarly, by only taking into account conduction current, :math:`\mathbf{J}_c`, secondary magnetic flux :math:`\mathbf{B}^{s}` can be evaluated. So if we define Biot-Savart operator :math:`G_{BS}[\cdot]` which takes currents, then primary, secondary, and total magentic fields can be defined as

.. math::
    \mathbf{B}^{p} = G_{BS}[\mathbf{J}_e]

.. math::
    \mathbf{B}^{s} = G_{BS}[\mathbf{J}_c]

.. math::
    \mathbf{B} =\mathbf{B}^{p}+\mathbf{B}^{s}
                   =G_{BS}[\mathbf{J}_e+\mathbf{J}_c]

Separating total magentic fields as primary and secondary will be useful for our following analyses to see impact of the eddy currents induced in the earth.

   A loop source in a half-space earth. :math:`\sigma_{air}` and :math:`\sigma_{earth}` conductivity of the air and earth, respectively. :math:`\mu_{0}` and :math:`\mu_{earth}` susceptibility of the air and earth, respectively. :math:`z` and offset correspondingly indicate Tx height (m) and Tx-Rx offset (m).

Using the setup shown in :numref:`Halfspace`, we perform a simulation, compute electric, magnetic fluxs, and current density. Here :math:`z` = 30 m, :math:`\sigma_{earth}=0.01` S/m, :math:`\mu_{earth}=\mu_0`, and :math:`f=10^3` Hz. :numref:`Half_EJ` shows imaginary part of electric fielc and current density in :math:`y`-direction.

Rotating electric field induced by oscillating magnetic field exist everywhere and show great amplitude at the near surface. Current density at an air region is zero, and this will make impact to the magnetic flux density. :numref:`Half_B_imag` shows imaginary part of :math:`\mathbf{B}`. Imaginary part of magnetic flux is localized at the near surface, and mostly propagating downward.

.. note::

  Imaginary part of :math:`\mathbf{B}` only includes secondary field i.e. it is soely from the earth. This will be directly related to real part of :math:`\mathbf{E}` from Eq. :eq:`faraday`.

   Imaginary part of total magnetic flux density.

Different from the imaginary part of :math:`\mathbf{B}`, real part includes both primary and secondary magnetic flux.
:numref:`Half_BpBs` a and b show the real part of total and secondary magnetic flux density as a vector. Primary flux is dominant in :math:`\mathbf{B}` hence signficantly localized close to Tx location, while secondary flux induced in the conductive earth are much more spreaded. Direction of the total (upward) and secondary flux (downward) is opposite in general.

.. question::

    Compare imaginary and real part of :math:`\mathbf{B}_s` :numref:`Half_B_imag` and :numref:`Half_BpBs` b. What is the main difference?
