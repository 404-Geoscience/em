Dipole Response from a Conductive and Magnetically Permeable Sphere
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We are interested in understanding the frequency-domain responses which are generated by ore bodies and unexploded ordnance items.
On a fundamental level, these responses may be understood by considering the excitation of a conductive and magnetically permeable sphere, under the influence of a harmonic inducing field.
The free-space response can also be used to represent a lower-accuracy approximation for compact bodies within resistive media.


Here, expressions derived by Wait (1951) are used to characterize the excitation of the sphere in terms of an induced dipole moment.
We examine how a target's dipole moment depends on its size and physical properties.


Governing Equations
===================



.. math::
	{\bf B} (\omega) =\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \Bigg [ \frac{3 {\bf r} \; \big [ {\bf m}(\omega) \cdot {\bf r} \; \big ]}{r^5} - \frac{{\bf m} (\omega) }{r^3} \Bigg ] 

.. math::
	{\bf m} (\omega) = \frac{4\pi}{3}R^3 \chi (\omega) \, {\bf H_0} (i \omega)


.. math::
	\chi (\omega) = \frac{3}{2} \Bigg [ \! \frac{2\mu \big [ tanh(\alpha) - \alpha  \big ] + \mu_0 \big [\alpha^2 \, tanh(\alpha) - \alpha + tanh(\alpha) \big ] }{\mu  \big [ tanh(\alpha) - \alpha \big ] - \mu_0 [ \alpha^2 \, tanh(\alpha) - \alpha + tanh(\alpha) \big ] } \! \Bigg ]

where

.. math::
	\alpha = \Big [ i \omega \mu \sigma \Big ]^{1/2} R
