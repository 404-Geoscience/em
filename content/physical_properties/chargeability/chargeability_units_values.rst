    **@DWO: does this go here, or with lab setup? (or elements in both?** Impedance curve with frequency (:math:`Z(\omega)`); :math:`sigma(\omega)`; definition of eta from the asymptotic values; transforming to time to get time dependent conductivity; over-voltage diagram; using V_inf and :math:`V_0` to theoretically define eta. 

.. todo:: 
    Units: the intrinsic changeability is dimensionless. :math:`[0,1]`. In practice surveys are explicitly designed to find chargeable material and the field data acquire units that correspond to the survey.  In this regard, any datum that is connected with chargeable .
