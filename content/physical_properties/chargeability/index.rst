    The electrical conductivity of a material can depend upon frequency. In Ohm's
    Law, :math:`J=\sigma E`, :math:`\sigma` is a complex number. The underlying
    microscopic phenomonae accounting for this is complicated and depends upon the
    minerals, grain sizes, and surface-to-volume ratios and the abundance of
    clays. There is no simple mathematical formula that describes the relation
    between conductivity and frequency but one that has some practical use is the
    Cole-Cole model.

    Formula for conductivity and for resistivity. Definitions of variables. eta is
    the "chargeability" (dimensionless :math:`0<\eta<1`); :math:`\eta` is often related to
    the concentration of a chargeable mineral, for instance eta is related to the
    total percentage of sulfide minerals. :math:`\tau` is a time constant generally thought
    to be related to grain size; :math:`c` is a variable associated with (?distribution of
    grain size?)

    Historically "chargeabilty" has been referred to as "over-voltage". The
    description arises from geophysial surveys in the 1950's and is illustrated in
    the following diagram:
