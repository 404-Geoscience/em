Electric and Ionic conductions
------------------------------

Electrical conductivity is the movement of electrical charge from on location to another, and two important charge carriers are electrons and ions, which will define conductivity of a rock. Considering this, we express conductivity as 

.. math::
	\sigma = n e \mu_e, 

where :math:`n` is the number of charge carriers, :math:`e` is charge carried by each charge carrier, and :math:`\mu_e` is the mobility of carriers. Hence, the conductivity of a rock can be determined by its capability to move charges by charge carriers: electrons and ions. This classified two main different types: a) Electric and b) Ionic conductions. 

Both conductions are related to random motion of particles affected by an applied electric field. However, how charge moves in conduction processes are quite different. The charge carrier for the electric conduction is electron, which will define conductivity of most metals such as iron and copper. The random motion of motion of valance electrons (a measure of its combining power with other atoms) among the atom is ordered by the application of an external electric field. The electrons then travel with a drift velocity through solid. 

For the ionic conduction, the charge carrier is ion. Considering most of surface rocks are saturated by some fluids (water, oil and gas, ... etc), conduction in surface rock is mostly electrolytic, taking place in the connected pore spaces, along grain boundaries and in fractures, but negligibly through the mineral grains or silicate framework (CITES). 


What makes a rock conductivity?
-------------------------------

Here are common factors determine conductivity of a rock:

	- Metallic particles 
	- Electrolyte in the pore of a rock with large number of ions
	- Temperature
	- Pressure
	- Porosity
	- Rock texture
	- Clay materials

If a rock includes metallic particles, obviously that rock will be conductive (electric conduction). 

Each ion is able to only a certain quantity of charge, it indicates that the more ions in an solution and faster they move, the greater charge will be carried which result in greater conductivity of a rock. Hence, the solution with the greater number of ions will have higher conductivity. Accordingly, a rock which includes saline water within its pores will have larger conductivity when the salinity of the water is high than when it is low. 

An increase in temperature will increase the mobility of ions in the solution resulting in an increase of the conductivity. Based upon that temperature increase and salinity decrease with depth, conductivity should increase with depth. However, the effect of pressure should be considered to understand conductivity of the earth with depth as we shall do later. 

Most minerals forming rocks are nonconductive. However, the porosity and pore distribution of a rock specimen will have effect on determining conductivity.
