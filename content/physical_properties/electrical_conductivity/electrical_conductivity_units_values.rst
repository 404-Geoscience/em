A fundamental relationship between the applied electric field and current governed by Ohmâ€™s law:

	.. math::
		\vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E},

where :math:`\vec{J}` is the electric current (A/:math:`m^2`) and :math:`\vec{E}` is the electric field (V/m). Accordingly, unit of the conductivity will be

	.. math::
		\frac{A/m^2}{V/m} = S/m,

where S=A/V is the conductance (S). Similarly, unit of the resistivity will be

	.. math::
		\frac{V/m}{A/m^2} = \Omega\text{-}m.

We interpret units of conductivity and resistitivity as

	- :math:`\sigma` (S/m): How much current flows with the applied electric field (or voltage).

	- :math:`\rho` (:math:`\Omega`-m): How much voltage (or electric field) is generated with the appliec current.

These can be related how we excite the system (source), and what we measure (receiver).

Electrical conductivity for common rocks
----------------------------------------

The charge might be carried by ions or electrons, whose mobilities are varying from different materials. Accordingly, conductivity spectrum is ranging from highly conducting metals to nearly perfect insulators as illustrated in Figure :numref:`resistivity_table1`.
