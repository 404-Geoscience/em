A fundamental relationship between the applied electric field and current governed by Ohm’s law:  

	.. math::

		\vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E}, 

where :math:`\vec{J}` is the electric current (A/:math:`m^2`) and :math:`\vec{E}` is the electric field (V/m). Accordingly, unit of the conductivity will be 

	.. math::

		\frac{A/m^2}{V/m} = S/m, 

where S=A/V is the conductance. Literally stating Ohm’s law, conductivity is how much current flows in a rock with the applied electric field. Similarly, unit of the resistivity will be

	.. math::

		\frac{V/m}{A/m^2} = \Omega\text{-}m. 

Electrical conductivity for common rocks
----------------------------------------

The charge might be carried by ions or electrons, whose mobilities are varying from different materials. Accordingly, conductivity spectrum is ranging from highly conducting metals to nearly perfect insulators as illustrated in Figure :numref:`resistivity_table1`.
