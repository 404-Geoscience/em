Electrical Conductivity
=======================

.. What is it

Electrical conductivity is an intrinsic property that quantifies how well electrical charges move in  a given material. As shown in :numref:`Chargeflow`, under the applied electric field, charges in a rock flow from positive to negative potential. Since electric current is how much charges move within a unit of time, a high conductivity means a material that readily allows the flow of electric current. In geophysics, conductivity is usually represented by the Greek letter :math:`\sigma` (S/m). 

Electrical resistivity is the reciprocal of electrical conductivity, and materialâ€™s ability to oppose an electric current. It is usually represented by the Greek letter :math:`\rho` (:math:`\Omega`-m) in geophysics. 
Since the resistivity is an equivalent concept, we focus on the conductivity in our following explanation.

.. Electrical conductivity is a physical property that describes how easily
.. electric currents can flow through a medium. Conductivity, and its reciprocal,
.. "resistivity", are used interchangeably. The conductivity of earth materials
.. depends on many factors but primarily upon mineral content, porosity,
.. saturating fluids, connecting paths and temperature.

.. Seogi Not sure we need to comment here. Rather, we have a section for complex conductivity
.. .. note::
..     The measured conductivity (or resistivity) often shows a frequency
..     dependence. Effectively the material can act like a capacitor and build up
..     a charge when an electric field is applied. The ability to accumulate
..     charge is called :ref:`"chargeability"<chargeability_index>` and the survey designed to measure the
..     effect is called an IP (Induced Polarization) or, SIP (spectral IP)
..     survey. Chargeabilty is often listed as an independent physical property
..     (such as density, magnetic suspectibilty) and we will continue with that
..     in this EM resource. It is however, just an element that is necessary in
..     order to provide a complete description of electrical conductivity.
