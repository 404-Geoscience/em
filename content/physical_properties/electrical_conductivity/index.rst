Electrical Conductivity
=======================

Electrical conductivity is a physical property that quantifies how well electrical charges move in a given material when subjected to an applied electric field. In mathematical development and in references describing rocks or fluids, it is common to refer to its reciprocal, resistivity. Conductivity is often frequency-dependent.  Effectively the material can act like a capacitor and build up a charge when an electric field is applied, that is, the material is "chargeable". The ability to accumulate charge,  called "chargeability" is so important in geophysics that it is often considered as another physical property. In this section we connect electrical conductivity with some of its applications through case histories, investigate the constitutive relationship and its laboratory foundation, compile useful tables and provide additional levels of information that are valuable.  See :ref:`electrical_conductivity_tables` for conductivity of various rocks provides tables for electrical conductivity and chargeability.

As shown in :numref:`Chargeflow` positive charges in a rock flow in the same direction as the electric field. In a circuit that involves a battery the charges move from the positive to negative potential. The electric current is how much charges move within a unit of time, a high conductivity means a material that readily allows the flow of electric current. In geophysics, conductivity is usually represented by the Greek letter :math:`\sigma` (S/m).

.. note::
    Chargeabilty is often listed as an independent physical property
    (such as density, magnetic suspectibilty) and we will continue with that
    in this EM resource. It is however, just an element that is necessary in
    order to provide a complete description of electrical conductivity.
