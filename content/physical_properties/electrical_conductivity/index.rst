Electrical Conductivity
=======================

.. What is it

Electrical conductivity is a physical property that describes how easily
electric currents can flow through a medium. Conductivity, and its reciprocal,
"resistivity", are used interchangeably. The conductivity of earth materials
depends on many factors but primarily upon mineral content, porosity,
saturating fluids, connecting paths and temperature.

.. note::
    The measured conductivity (or resistivity) often shows a frequency
    dependence. Effectively the material can act like a capacitor and build up
    a charge when an electric field is applied. The ability to accumulate
    charge is called :ref`"chargeability"<electrical_chargeability>` and the survey designed to measure the
    effect is called an IP (Induced Polarization) or, SIP (spectral IP)
    survey. Chargeabilty is often listed as an independent physical property
    (such as density, magnetic suspectibilty) and we will continue with that
    in this EM resource. It is however, just an element that is necessary in
    order to provide a complete description of electrical conductivity.

**TODO: where is it diagnostic?**
