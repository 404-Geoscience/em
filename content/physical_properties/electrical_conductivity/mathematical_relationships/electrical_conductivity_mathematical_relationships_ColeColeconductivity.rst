Cole Cole Conductivity
======================

In a conductivity form, this can be written as

.. math::
    \sigma(\omega) = \sigma_{\infty}\Big(1-\frac{\eta}{1+(1-\eta)(\imath\omega\tau)^c} \Big),
    :label: colecole_pelton_sig

where :math:`\sigma_{\infty}` is conductivity at infinite frequency.
