   A simple DC circuit.

For a simple circuit, Ohm's law:

.. math::
   V=IR

where

- :math:`V`: Voltage (V)
- :math:`I`: Current (A)
- :math:`R`: Resistance (Ohm)


In the lab, the resistor shown in :numref:`DCcircuit_simple` is replaced by cube with size :math:`L`. Accordingly, resistivity and conductivity can be expressed as

   - Resistivity: :math:`\rho = \frac{RA}{L}` (:math:`\Omega\text{-}m`)
   - Conductivity: :math:`\sigma = \frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{L}{RA}` (:math:`S/m`)

Ohm's law analogous to :math:`V=IR` for the circult case become

.. math::
   \mathbf{E}= \rho \mathbf{J},

where

   - :math:`\mathbf{J}` is the electric current (A/:math:`m^2`)
   - :math:`\mathbf{E}` is the electric field (V/m).

But it is usually written as

.. math::
   \mathbf{J}= \sigma \mathbf{E}.
