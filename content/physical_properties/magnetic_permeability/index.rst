Magnetic Permeability
=====================

Magnetic fields can be represented by their field intensity :math:`\vec H`, or by their flux density :math:`\vec B`.
The ratio between the magnetic flux density and the magnetic field intensity within a material is called the magnetic permeability :math:`\mu`, thus:

.. math::
	{\bf B}(\omega) = \mu \, {\bf H}(\omega)
	:label: Const_Rel_Flux

For non-permeable materials, :math:`\mu` is given by the permeability of free-space :math:`\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}` T :math:`\!\cdot\!` m/A.
The magnetic permeability is sometimes represented in terms of its proportionality 

.. math::
	\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0}
	:label: Rel_Permeability
