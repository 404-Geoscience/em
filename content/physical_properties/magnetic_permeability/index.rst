Magnetic Permeability
=====================

Magnetic fields can be represented by their intensity :math:`{\bf H}`, or by their flux density :math:`{\bf B}`.
For magnetic fields which are sufficiently small in magnitude, magnetic permeability :math:`\mu` is the ratio between the magnetic flux density within a material, and the intensity of an applied magnetic field:

.. math::
	{\bf B}(\omega) = \mu \, {\bf H}(\omega)
	:label: Const_Rel_Flux
	


However, when exposed to a magnetic field, individual magnetic dipole moments within permeable materials have a tendency to reorient themselves along the direction of the field (Figure).
This generates a non-zero magnetization, which ultimately impacts the density of magnetic flux throughout the material.

 






Therefore, the magnetic permeability represents a diagnostic parameter for characterizing the degree of magnetization induced within a material.

The magnetic properties of permeable materials are sometimes represented by the relative permeability.
Where :math:`\mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7}` T :math:`\!\cdot\!` m/A is the permeability of free-space, the relative permeability :math:`\mu_r` is given by:

.. math::
	\mu_r = \frac{\mu}{\mu_0}
	:label: Rel_Permeability

where :math:`\mu >1` characterizes materials which generate secondary fields in the same direction as the applied field, and :math:`\mu <1` characterizes materials which generate fields opposing the primary field.
