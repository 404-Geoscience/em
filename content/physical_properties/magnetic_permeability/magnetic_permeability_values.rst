Typical Values for Rocks
========================
	
The range of magnetic susceptibilities (in SI) for rocks is illustrated is Figure (needs reference).
Recall that magnetic permeabilities for these rocks may be obtained using the appropriate expression from the units section (link).
Black and white bars are used to provide the range of magnetic susceptibility values for more distinct rock types.
