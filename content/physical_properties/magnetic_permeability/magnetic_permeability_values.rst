Typical Values for Rocks
========================
	
The range of magnetic susceptibilities (in SI) for rocks is illustrated in Figure (needs reference).
Recall that magnetic permeabilities for these rocks may be obtained using the appropriate expression from the units section (link).
Black and white bars are used to provide the range of magnetic susceptibility values for more distinct rock types.
Vertical dashed red lines are used to represent the approximate magnetic susceptibility of rocks, based on \% volume magnetite.
