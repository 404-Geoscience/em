Geophysical Surveys   
===================

Contents:


DWO: Here we present each field survey technique and make links with EM.geosci
For example:

DC Resistivity (DCR)
General overview of the survey (material from 350 plus some new stuff;) 
	put a current into the ground and measure the electric potentials (figures)
	Constant current so steady state equations apply  (links to formative equations;)
	Equations are solved numerically (links)
	Potentials for a uniform halfspace (link) or buried sphere.
	Data as apparent resistivity
	Pseudo-section
	Field acquisition (generators, receivers, cables)
	Inverting data (Links)

Other items that come into play in practise
	Effects of topograhy
	Assignment of uncertainties

Survey Design
	Factors that are important
	Depth of investigation
