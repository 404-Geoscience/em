Geophysical Surveys   
===================

Many types of geophysical surveys are carried out. In this section we investigate these individually. For each survey we provide background information about the survey, data acquisition, processing and practical issues that need to be addressed in order to extract meaningful information from the data.

DWO: Here we present each field survey technique and make links with EM.geosci
For example:

DC Resistivity (DCR)
General overview of the survey (material from 350 plus some new stuff;) 
- put a current into the ground and measure the electric potentials (figures)
- Constant current so steady state equations apply  (links to formative equations;)
- Equations are solved numerically (links)
- Potentials for a uniform halfspace (link) or buried sphere.
- Data as apparent resistivity
- Pseudo-section
- Field acquisition (generators, receivers, cables)
- Inverting data (Links)

Other items that come into play in practise
- Effects of topograhy
- Assignment of uncertainties

Survey Design
- Factors that are important
- Depth of investigation
