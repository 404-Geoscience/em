.. _power_supply:

Power supply
____________
A generator or battery provides a source of power for the tranmitter in geophysical surveys.

.. _transmitters:

Transmitters/sources
____________________
A transmitter sends out a desired current waveform through the current wire. Current (or voltage) can be regulated by the transmitter controller and can be any amount within the power limit. The instrument can measure the current amplitude.

**DC resistivity**: Electrodes need good contact with the ground, especially when the length of the rod is comparable with the scale of near-surface inhomogeneity. Salty water and wrapping the electrode with a soaked cloth can help. Often the electrodes are steel or iron rods. Inductive source resistivity. Insulated wires. Ohm's law to measure the current and potential difference

**Frequency-domain EM**:

**Time-domain EM**:

**Natural source EM**:

**DC resistivity**: Two electrodes are used to measure the voltage difference in DC resistivity. Non-polarizing electrodes are commonly porous pots with an electric wire in a salt solution. It is also common to use lead wire in a lead-chloride mix or copper wire in a copper-sulphate solution. This eliminates self potential between the wire and the ground. It also improves the quality of the data. The voltage potential is measured between electrodes as a continuous array for the whole survey. Super-position theory allows for calculation of potentials between any pair of potential electrodes as long as the data was collected simultaneously.

**Electromagnetics**:

Common survey layouts
_____________________

Below are common survey layouts that can be used. *Maybe better suited for the survey design page?*

**Pole-dipole**: A DC resistivity survey using a single current electrode (the second current electrode is at "infinity" or really far from the survey area) and two potential electrodes. Conventionally, the electrodes are placed in a linear line away from the transmitter electrode for a 2D survey as shown in the figure below (*need citation for figure*).
