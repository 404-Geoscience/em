Electromagnetic Geophysics
==========================

**Purpose of GeoSci EM:** To facilitate the understanding and use of
electromagnetics in solving exploration, geotechnical and environmental
problems.

The emphasis is on  physical principles of electromagnetic methods and their
application in solving problems. Rigorous analytic solutions of the EM
problems with specific transmitting fields and earth models is left to
existing books and research papers. Also, the resource does not concentrate
upon the scientific computing aspects to numerically solve Maxwellâ€™s
equations. We do however, make much use of software that can perform those
functions. Rather, our emphasis is on using analytic and numerical solutions
to understand electromagnetic  fields and fluxes obtained from various types
of transmitters in different geological environments.
