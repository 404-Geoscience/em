Why EM GeoSci
-------------

Electromagnetics has not yet reached its full potential for solving problems
in the geosciences. However that is changing and today the combination of
better field systems and high quality data, advances in scientific computing,
and the exponential increase in computer power allows us to solve problems
that were not possible a few years ago. It is becoming more common-place to
acquire laboratory or in-situ measurements of physical properties and these
are essential links in tying the geophysics to questions about the earth. The
other advance is the open-source technology
allow technical  material and ideas to be generated by multiple contributors
through sources like Github_ . Cloud-based computing environments and
open source software have also opened up portals for interacting with equations
and concepts in real time as material is being read. The goal of :ref:`EM GeoSci <em_index>`
is to blend these items as seamlessly as possible and provide a learning
environment in which geoscientists with various backgrounds and expertise can
connect with the application of electromagnetics in their field of study.
Having a resource that allows participants to answer many different questions
connected with electromagnetics will enhance efficiency of research and
applications. Moreover, this resource provides an explicit repository for
knowledge that has been acquired by practising geoscientists and, when made
available, can elevate the learning and responsible use of electromagnetics
throughout the communinity.

.. _what:

What is EM GeoSci?
------------------

The emphasis is on  physical principles of electromagnetic methods and their
application in solving problems. Rigorous analytic solutions of the EM
problems with specific transmitting fields and earth models is left to
existing books and research papers. Also, the resource does not concentrate
upon the scientific computing aspects to numerically solve Maxwellâ€™s
equations. We do however, make much use of software that can perform those
functions. Rather, our emphasis is on using analytic and numerical solutions
to understand electromagnetic  fields and fluxes obtained from various types
of transmitters in different geological environments.

Our emphasis is on fundamentals and applications and correspondingly
:ref:`case_histories_index` play an essential role. These provide the
motivation for using electromagnetics and show the success, or not, of their
application in making an impact upon the problem at hand.

Examples are available through `Jupyter Notebooks`_ and can be run through Binders_.
The simulations use the open-source Simulation and Parameter Estimation package
SimPEG_.

This resource is Open Source and while currently being led by brilliant
and enthusiastic graduate students and faculty at UBC, the vision is to have
experts, worldwide, contribute. Join the development on Github_ or

EM GeoSci is under construction
-------------------------------

EM GeoSci is under active construction. We are working to fill in blank
pages and address todo's. Our  goal is to have a mature version available by the
end of 2017. In the meantime, we are making this resource available and
`inviting contributions for case histories <http://disc2017.geosci.xyz/#contribute>`_.
We welcome `feedback <http://geosci.xyz/contact>`_ about the useability of the site and the technical details.

The motivation for the structure of em.geosci follows from
:ref:`introduction_basic_electromagnetic_experiments`. The goal is to identify
topics that are logically self-contained and then use links to connect them.
At the large scale we have the following items.

- :ref:`introduction_index`:

  - Provides motivational examples, outlines the site, takes care of housekeeping
    items like notation

|

- :ref:`physical_properties_index`:

  - Is the "go-to" location for information about what the properties are, how
    they are measured, typical values etc.

|

- :ref:`maxwell1_fundamentals_index`:

  - This contains a summary and background about the formative laws
    that are the basis for Maxwell's
    equations as well as an introduction to general topics that and not survey specific.
    (eg  the basic equations in the frequency and time domain, interface conditions, concepts of fields and fluxes,
    plane waves in homogeous media, fields from electric and magnetic dipoles etc.
    )

|

- :ref:`maxwell2_static_index`:

  - This section pertains to the understanding the steady-state Maxwell's and its
    applications. Foundations for DC resistivity (DCR); Magnetometric resistivity
    (MMR), and magnetic surveys are found here.

|

- :ref:`maxwell3_fdem_index`:

  - This section pertains to understanding Maxwell's equations in the frequency
    domain. Foundations for galvanic, inductive and natural source surveys in
    frequency are presented.

|

- :ref:`maxwell4_tdem_index`:

  - This section pertains to understanding Maxwell's equations in the time domain.

|

- :ref:`geophysical_surveys_index`:

  - Self-contained folders for individual geophysical surveys are provided. For
    example DCR provides a comprehensive overview about the DC resistivity survey
    as well as links to case histories. Each Survey is linked to relevant sections
    in other portions of em.geosci so that comprehensive knowledge can be
    accessed.

|

- :ref:`inversion`:

  - This provides basic tutorial information about inversion that is applicable to
    all em surveys.

|

- :ref:`case_histories_index`:

  - These form the cornerstones of our site. They motivate the use of EM
    geophysics and they also dictate what material needs to be developed in the
    background sections. Each case history is presented with a Seven-Step
    Framework.
